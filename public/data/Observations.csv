Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    It is a great idea to use your Morning Message to go over some grammar work.  You pointed out how one student was pausing at the period that he inserted.    I am very glad to see you doing Guided Reading.  This is one way to deliberately use the independent work time.    You have some nice routines in place for how students sit during independent reading (e.g. on rug with cushions backs to their tables) and book shopping.    You were clear in stating your teaching point.    Next Steps:    1) Be clear and consistent with your expectations for student behavior and engagement.    2) Be cognizant of how your body language and tone of voice contribute to or take away from the sense of connectedness and community in your classroom.    3) Structure your classroom environment with student independence in mind.  Work on developing organizational structures and clear usable charts.    5) Model the teaching point by actually showing students how to do something (rather than telling them what you do).  Use visuals (e.g. chart Elmo) to assist students in seeing and understanding what you do.    4) Actively seek out and participate in professional learning opportunities to improve your practice.  Take note of feedback given and follow through actively with suggestions and next steps.      Over the next two weeks I will schedule three inter-visitations for you.  During each of these inter-visitations you and I will look closely at a) the organizational structures and routines that teachers have in place; b) the teacher's language tone and body language; and c) the way the teacher models a teaching point.    Please email me one reading workshop lesson plan for the week of January 24th by Friday January 22nd.  I will provide you with feedback related to the explicitness of the modeling portion of your minilesson.

0570714,2016,966304,2016-03-28 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,It was impressive to see you try and push your students to think deeper about the books they read by not just focusing on the changes of the main characters; which tend to be more obvious but to consider what is happening to the other characters as well and how that helps us better understand the big ideas/lessons in a text.  It is also evident that you are building on your practice of planning strategically for individual student needs.   I was also impressed with how you utilized human resources during your lesson.  For example you had Ms. Ivelisse work on the graphic organizer on the document camera while you modeled your think alouds and the text from the front of the room.  This allowed you to keep your eyes on the class.  When Ms. Ivelisse had to take the boys having a hard time out for a walk you asked a student to come to the document camera and work on it for you.  This allowed this student to be fully invested in what was happening and it also provided her with a leadership role in the class; which build confidence.    It is clear you are still struggling a bit with management; which impacts the flow of your lessons and ultimately your students' achievement.  You need to address the seating arrangements in your class; particularly at the carpet.  There are two issues I noticed at your carpet.    1. Students are sitting too close to the board and in very close proximity to each other.  Whenever a student moved to adjust him/herself he/she inadvertently touch bumped or pushed a classmate.  While you have students this did not affect at all you have multiple students who became distracted or even agitated by this (e.g. Damon Giann Jayden T.)  Open up the seat spots on the carpet so that students have more space in between peers and move the students in the front row back a bit.  They are sitting directly under the board; which makes it difficult to see the smart board projections.  2.   Your seating should be very intentional.  Consider not only ability (who can effectively engage who in discussion) but also relationships.  For example Jorge Gabriel and Damon sat relatively close to each other and on multiple times distracted each other by pulling on each other's feet or playfully hitting each other.  In particular Jorge and Gabriel seem to easily distract each other and when they do they distract the rest of the group.  They should sit apart from each other.  Decide which one should be closer to Ms. Ivelisse and the other should be closer to you.  In this way they each have an adult who can use proximity to redirect behaviors.    One additional suggestion is around your use of the chime.  Students are not responding to you when you use it.  Your students are also very active and require lots of movement.  You will need to consider using kinesthetic activities for transitions between your lesson.  I suggest activities from the Move to Improve curriculum; which Ms. Ivelisse is familiar with as she has been trained in this program by the YMCA.    In regards to your mini lesson; as discussed during your post observation monitor the length of your mini lesson.  You should use a timer to keep yourself aware of and track your time during the mini lesson.  As you also pointed out during your post observation in future lessons where you are modeling the use of a tracking sheet or graphic organizer you should model a portion of it and allow another portion of the sheet to be completed as part of the active engagement with their partners.  In this way you can also go around and observe and take note of who is struggling with the task and who is ready to work on their own.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You made your expectations for student respect for each other clear.    You used verbal reminders to refocus students.    You asked students to explain their thinking during the discussion of transportation.  As a result students engaged in a genuine discussion.    Next Steps:    Work to utilize VTS question steps and follow-up prompts (e.g. What do you notice?; Why do you say that?) as you facilitate discussions and critical thinking.    Work to consistently develop student content vocabulary facilitating opportunities for them to transfer and utilize already introduced vocabulary.  Make your expectations for vocabulary use clear to students and provide tools that will help students utilize already learned vocabulary.
0628127,2014,144814,2013-12-04 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the feedback with which I provided you at our post-observation conference on December 17 2013:    Highlights    You provided the class with a chart that had step-by-step directions for independent work on it.  This evidences that you were thinking ahead to the difficulties that students might have as they get started on their independent work and/or finish part of the independent work.    There was a helpful chart in the middle of each table inside a sheet protector that gave students guidelines for what to do when they were struggling.  The sign said: “Before I raise my hand I will… -reread the problem and try again; -ask the person next to me for help; -use classroom resources.”  This is a good tool to help build independence.    You asked Mr. Leo (City Year) to take note of the method students were using to solve the multiplication problem.  You provided him with a pre-made template on which to jot these notes.  By collecting this data you set the stage to be able to group the students meaningfully in the following days.    To Work On as You Move Forward    At the start of the period you told the class “I’m going to write a very complicated statement.”  The phrase you wrote down was “To relate multiplication equations and comparison statements.”  As the students were writing this in their notebooks you said to the class “Just get that down.  Just get that down.  As you’re writing just listen up.  When we say relate you have relations…when you talk about the word relate we’re talking about a connection…What word do you hear in the word comparisons?”  Be mindful that it is likely difficult for most of the students in the class to concentrate on both what you are saying to them and what they are writing down.  Wait to speak until students can give you their full attention.    Additionally the statement you wrote is somewhat confusing.  Since an equation is by definition a comparison you might have the students write down something more understandable so that they might be able to more easily return to their notes at a later date.  For example you could write something like this: “Writing Multiplication Equations with an Unknown Variable.”  You can have the students write it more like a title for the page.    Questions were often used as a method of ensuring that students were on task rather than as a way to stimulate critical thought.  The questions you asked included the following:  •“Now there’s a situation and the situation says that Carly has 9 pennies.  How many pennies does Carly have?”  •“Now the first thing we do when we’re facing a word problem.  What’s the first thing we do?  We read the?”  •“We read the problem.  What do we do?”  •“So right now who can tell me the question?  What are we being asked to find?”  •“How many does Carly have?”  •“Let me ask you a question.  What is it that we are comparing?”  •“Do I stop there or do I continue?”  •“So how many more sets do I need?”  •“The question now is how much does Jack have?”  •“How do you know it’s 36?”  •“So Numa is saying it is 36.  How did you do it?”  •“What does that remind you of?  What did you do?”  •“What did we know?  We knew that Jack had four times as many as Carly.”  •“What did you notice about how measurement went back?  Did they make any noise?  No they didn’t make any noise.”  •“How helpful was it Jada to draw the diagram?”    Of these questions five of them required students only to repeat information that was already stated by you or in the book.  You answered one of the questions yourself before students had a chance to respond.  Two of the questions (See highlighted questions above) required students to explain their thinking.  These are key questions when working to promote students’ independent and critical thinking.  Be mindful however that when questions like this are posed children have plenty of time to think and even talk to each other.  Be mindful of your wait time and work to build in opportunities for students to talk to each other.  When planning your lessons be sure to specifically plan questions that require students to think critically.  Avoid questions that simply require students to regurgitate or locate information.  Finally avoid asking questions and then answering them yourself.    Although you had a nice chart of step-by-step directions posted you stated to the students on two occasions that they should see you when they finish the first problem and before moving on to the second problem.  Three minutes after the independent work began you stated “Call me when you’re done okay?”  Eight minutes after the independent work began eight students had complete papers and were sitting doing nothing.  Two of these students had their hands raised.  Eleven minutes after the independent work period started you stated to the class “If you’re finished working on number 1 and I’ve seen it or Mr. Leo’s seen it you can go to number 2.” It is nearly an impossible task for you to see every student in the timeframe that they need to be seen.  As a result of you making these statements only one student in the class (Jada) followed the directions that you had written on chart paper.  Instead plan out one or two small groups or two to three individual conferences every day and work to put into place guidelines that students cannot check in with you during independent work and must follow the steps for what to do when they finished one assigned task (as you had posted).
0628127,2014,195623,2014-01-16 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,-During your mini lesson you chose to model how to "tackle a word problem" by showing your students the steps you take through a think aloud.  Next time you model your thinking process consider using your projector to clearly and explicitly model your process. During your model you were using a word problem you already broke apart and annotated with a previous class.  The chart was already marked up and therefore took away from your model of how you thought about and chose to tackle the word problem.  In addition at the end of your model you said "let's review" (how to tackle word problems).  A chart of the steps you took (take) when tackling word problems would be helpful to students.  In this way they have a tool to help them tackle their own word problems moving forward.  During your next model consider projecting your word problem (as stated above) and then charting your steps alongside so students can refer to when they set off to work independently or in partnerships/groups.

Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,While this is a test-prep unit please consider how to create opportunities for your students to explore the vocabulary practice strategies and review complex passages that are content-specific in a way that engages them in critical thinking and authentic discussion.  Some ideas I am having are  -creating vocabulary games  -giving students old test questions and have them analyze the questions and the responses looking for similarities  -playing jeopardy  -having students create study guides and quiz their partners    I look forward to hearing other ideas you may be having and how I can support you with strengthening your test prep unit.

Students and adults were respectful of one another and easily followed through with procedures.    Next Step:    Write out your script for your mini-lesson ahead of time.  Your mini-lesson should have a clear main idea and be without repetition.  There should be a clear modeling component which should take less than five minutes.  Please practice your script ahead of time.  I will be in at 10:00 on Friday January 23rd to observe your writing mini-lesson.  Please see Ms. Cruz or Ms. Severino if you would like some help ahead of time.

You engaged students with high level academic vocabulary.    Next Steps:    Work to give clear directions one or two times.    Be very aware of how much wait time you provide to students to read and think.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your lesson plan evidences your pre-thinking about how your lessons are all fitting together.    Your lesson plan evidences your intention to be clear and concise during the teach portion of your lesson.    Next Steps:    Be sure that you are clear on the specific purpose of the lesson as you are planning it.    Always tell students what they are doing/learning and why.  Explicitly name the purpose of the lesson and/or experiment/inquiry work.    Be attentive to students' social-emotional needs.  When you notice a student in distress listen in to her/his concerns validate the emotion and see if a solution can be figured out.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,I am curious to learn more about the Green Beetz program and I'm sure your students' competitive nature have been tapped into with this fun and interesting approach to exploring and understanding food the world the human body and the impact each has on the other.     Next Steps:  -Students need to be more involved in the experimentation and exploration of the concepts you are uncovering.  When planning your next experiment think about how to engage students in the scientific method.  They should explore and engage in experiments that will allow them to have conversations with each other about their findings.  For your next experiment with this class/grade plan your activity so that each group will be able to investigate a concept partake in the scientific method and prepare to report out to the class or another group.  You should also include the use of a timer so that you can ensure they have enough time in the end to analyze their results compare with peers and engage in discussion that will help them synthesize their learning.  I'd love for you to submit a lesson of an experiment you intend on having students engage in within the next two weeks.  I'd like to review it and provide feedback if needed.
0628127,2016,990132,2016-05-05 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,It is clear by the use of the content-vocabulary by some of the children in their responses during your whole group discussion that you are constantly exploding them to content-specific language.  It is also evident that students are familiar with the concept you are teaching and are working to build knowledge.  John's correct responses to naming each part of an electrical circuit is reflective of this.    Overall I think you need to give more attention to how you design your instructional order to engage students int he learning process.  At this point you are dominating the thinking and talking in your lesson; which means you are doing more of the work resulting in students being more passive and compliant.  You are also losing too much instructional time on logistical matters (e.g. arriving on time setting up charts and TP  distributing materials etc.)  While it is completely understandable and expected that you would need time to set your charts and material up for the lesson it should not take up so much of the students' instructional time.  You will need to develop more effective structures and systems to ensure students are engaged throughout the entire instructional period.  Here are a few ideas:   -identify student monitors who will be responsible for setting up the materials per table/station when you arrive while you set up the charts  -provide students with a warm up/do now question or activity to work on while you set yourself up.  -give students an article to read to set the stage and prepare them for the lesson while you set up  -studnets review notes from last lesson and develop a question they want answered by the end of this lesson.  At the next lesson they will review their notes (along with the answer from their previous lesson's question) and identify a new question or idea they want to explore.    These are of course not the only way to get students engaged while you are setting up for the lesson but it is meant to get you to start thinking of different ways to review reinforce remind students of the content while you set up.  I'd love to hear what ideas you have for this.  Please review your current system and identify two possible warm ups/do nows you'd like to try in the coming weeks of school.  I will want to discuss these during your upcoming reflection conference to be scheduled in the next two weeks.  This will give you two weeks to try out some of these warm ups/do nows so we can debrief on.
0628127,2017,1094637,2016-11-18 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You used the start of the period to recap what the class did during the previous meeting and set the stage for the work to be done next.    You encouraged students to notice and utilize their data as scientists do.    Student behavior was generally appropriate throughout the observed period.  You used the chime and reminding language effectively.    You asked some open-ended questions that provided students with opportunities to think themselves.      Next Steps:    Please ensure that you are on time and fully prepared for all lessons so that students get their full 45 minute period of science.  This is especially important when students only see you once a week like Class 3-204.  During this period you arrived at 10:23 and then had to go back to your office to retrieve a particular chart.  The class period ultimately began at 10:25 although it is scheduled to begin at 10:15 a.m.    Be sure that you always name your objective(s) clearly for yourself when developing your plan for each lesson.  This should be the big idea that you want students to understand by the end of the lesson or the skill that you want students to be able to do by the end of the lesson.  Then develop a teaching point that aligns to this objective and has a what and how.  Finally ensure that all activities in the lesson directly align to the desired outcomes and stated teaching point.  Please submit one lesson plan for third grade to me on Friday December 2nd and Friday December 9th.  I will review both for alignment and return them to you by Sunday of each of these weekends so that you have time to make changes if necessary.    Continue to plan for and ask open-ended questions.  When asking big thoughtful questions work to provide opportunities for more students to think and talk.  Consider partnerships or small group discussions at these times of rich thought.

0633596,2014,142104,2014-01-27 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the feedback in-brief that I sent you on January 28 2014:    When I arrived you were working with Jacob Brandon and Houssain on guided reading. The rest of the students in the class were reading independently. Throughout the 17 minutes that I was in your classroom the students read with diligence. There was a soft buzz in the classroom of students reading their books.     At your guided reading group you were prepared with a guided reading lesson plan. The students each had a book in front of them when I arrived. During the lesson you gave each student a post-it note with reminder strategies (look at the picture use the first and last letter sound) on it. You had pre-developed these and placed one by each student.    As you noted you did scaffold Houssain a lot. He was prompted over and over again with various reminders. Among some of the reminders and prompts you gave were the following "Use the picture" "What do you see in the picture" "Remember how the pattern goes" "Let's look for a little word in here. What do we know" "Check this word" "Check the first letter and the last letter." Houssain was interrupted so much that he did not have the opportunity to struggle with the text on his own at all. Remember that the bulk of the guided reading time should be an opportunity for students to read while you observe and listen. Because you did so much on the spot instruction you also did not have a chance to notice his habits and take any notes or plan for a teaching point following the student reading. Remember the TC guided reading structure calls for a teaching point after students read -- something you've noticed they are all not doing and related to the text level. Work to ensure that you have your toolkit available at all times and that in your toolkit you have great texts to use to demonstrate various skills and strategies. So for example if you noticed that all the students were struggling with using the first and last letter sound you could pull out a mentor text from your toolkit and turn to the page you have post-it noted for that skill. You could then demonstrate that skill and have the students go back and reread.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,I would like you to meet with Mrs. Gomez to share some of the practices within the flow of the reading recovery process.  She is currently working with a fourth grade young lady who is reading at a first grade level of H/I.  She could benefit from your expertise in repetitive practice and miscue analysis and intervention.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your responses to Patrick were measured consistent respectful and firm.    You were responsive to students' individual reading needs as they came up.    The text's content kept Patrick engaged throughout the session.      Next Steps:    Work to push student thinking with a well-planned open-ended question following the detail questions that you pose to check for understanding.  For example after students read an informational text you can pose a question about author's purpose.  In this case a thought-provoking question related to the author's intention could be: "What do you think the author of this text wants readers to understand about the job of being a firefighter?"

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You individualized your instruction to meet Daysha's individual needs.    You worked to provide Daysha with strategies she could use to self-correct.    You used strategic questions to intellectually engage Daysha with the new text.  You used text questions to encourage her comprehension of the text.    You provided opportunities for Daysha to practice in her classroom and at home.    Next Steps:    Consider ways to involve other school and family stakeholders in students' development.  You have opportunities to so closely observe and get to know students.  Consider calling team meetings to discuss individual students or organize action plans for particular students and families via email.  For example in Daysha's case you could organize a meeting with Ms. Santana Ms. Vega (Community School Director) Ms. Adams and possibly mom to discuss Daysha's lethargy and see how we can work together in all school and home contexts to encourage similar behaviors that you are working towards in your one-on-one sessions (e.g. sitting up moving more quickly keeping the momentum going).  You could put together a list of possible things for mom to do and say at home to encourage these habits in various contexts (e.g. at the dinner table while doing homework).  You could also brainstorm ways to involve Daysha's pediatrician in the conversation to see if particular conditions might play a role in her lethargy.  You are in a unique position to know students very well.  Consider how you can maximize the impact of this personal knowledge of individual students.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,POOLMAN BETHANY,Your work with Brianny in this one-on-one reading intervention session shows that you are well-versed in reading instruction and have the knowledge and skills to help students learn how to read.  Further your approach was focused yet warm adding a bit of joy to what could be a robotic process if emotion was removed entirely.  The result is a space where students feel emboldened to tackle something that might be a hindrance challenge or embarrassment during other parts of the day.  The work you do is critical for these students.    Something to consider:  What specific technique or strategy can be used if a student begins to struggle with stamina after reading multiple texts?  In this lesson by the last few pages Brianny was showing signs of fatigue most notably in her frequency of mistakes and slowdown of pace as she looked around the room more and more.  What do you think can be done when this starts to happen?  How can we address this over time?

Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),JIMENEZ JAILALL RAJENDRA,Lesson Plan:    Teaching point: Non-fiction readers read with their explaining voices and explain the text to themselves as they go along.     Connection: Readers you learned that non-fiction text is read with an explaining voice.  We are going to use what you learned to help you explain what you are reading in your own words.    Teaching: “Today I want to teach you that one way readers make sense of their information they read across pages is by asking themselves how does their page fit with the one before it?  Or what are both of these pages talking about?  Information readers don’t just read with explaining voices; information readers also explain the text to themselves as they go along – they pause after reading for a bit and use their own words if they can.  The explaining voice in their heads is like a teacher who makes sure they understand each section before moving on.  This not lonely helps them understand the text better it also prepares them to talk with and teach others club members about their topics.”  Model this to students using a non-fiction text.    Active engagement: now it is your turn Use your explaining voice as you read and then use that same voice to help explain what you learned.      Share: Students share how they used their explaining voice as they read and how it helped them with explaining what they read.    Link: So whenever you are reading non-fiction texts it is important to use your explaining voice and use that same voice as your explain what you learned.

Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,EMAIL FEEDBACK FOLLOWING INFORMAL OBSERVATION:   "I am not sure what your lesson objective was as it wasn't posted anywhere and students when asked were unable to tell me the teaching point or strategy or skill they were working on. In addition from what I observed students were given a play/skit: Brer Rabbit Shares His Crops and were asked to read it in partnerships.  When circulating the room you asked students to figure out the summary the plot of what is happening in the text.  However when you regrouped the class together as a whole you asked them to listen for voice and to pay attention to see if the readers are reading in a narrative voice or an informative voice.  Upon reviewing your lesson plan it is still very unclear to me what your instructional purpose for this lesson was as your lesson plan states that the teaching point is "Non-fiction readers read with their explaining voices and explain the text to themselves as they go along."  The plan you provided is disconnected entirely from what I observed.  Please clarify for me here.  If this was not in actuality your intended lesson please submit your lesson to me as soon as possible so that I may better understand where you were going with this lesson.  I am also unsure of how you determined whether students were attaining the goal you set out for them.  There was no evidence of you monitoring or tracking student progress.  Please note that when teaching a skill or strategy you need to pay attention to students' progress in order to determine what your next steps will be.  Conference notes checklists rubrics or teacher-made strategy/skill tracking sheets are all useful tools to help you monitor and track student progress.  You just need to be clear on the instructional outcome you are monitoring/tracking.  Please see your USB for sample conference templates.    Overall your lesson and lesson plan are very disconnected and your lesson itself felt very disconnected as well.  Students were told to summarize but not provided any strategies to do this.  Students were told to pay attention to punctuation and read with expression but this was not modeled. Students were all given the same text to read; however this is an ICT class in which the reading levels range from D-S as per the Google DRA tracker shared with the school.  While many of the students range from M-P there are a few students reading far below grade level and a few reading far above.  Please ensure you are making strategic instructional decisions that are purposeful and allow the context/content to be accessible to all your learners (e.g. choosing text that are at their instructional or independent reading levels).  Also in addition to text when thinking about the instructional outcome for your lesson you need to consider an effective strategy that will engage your students and give them ample opportunity to practice and work toward mastery of the outcome you intend. During Friday's observation it seems students were simply given an activity to do during the period rather than an activity or task linked to a learning outcome."      LESSON PLAN SUBMITTED:  Teaching point: Non-fiction readers read with their explaining voices and explain the text to themselves as   they go along.      Connection: Readers you learned that non-fiction text is read with an explaining voice. We are going to use   what you learned to help you explain what you are reading in your own words.

0761667,2014,242759,2014-01-07 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the written feedback that I gave you during our post-observation conference on January 9 2014:    Highlights    You work hard to ensure that students are focused on the work at hand and do not interact negatively with one another.  You worked to engage the students in various ways.  First you planned thoroughly and paced the lesson appropriately.  You provided students with personalized response cards during the independent work. During the mini-lesson you used a piece of paper on the floor to represent the fence in the book.  Finally you used lighthearted jokes (such as when you said to Jakheem “Can’t touch the fence either Jakheem! and the whole class including Jakheem chuckled) to engage them.     You worked to scaffold students’ learning in various ways.  You provided them with questions to discuss.  You provided them with prompts to complete in writing.  You used post-its to separate students’ ideas writing ‘World’ on one post-it and ‘Behavior’ on the other post-it.    To Work On as You Move Forward    During the time when you were modeling your own thinking you deliberately pointed out to the students how you were going back to the text to find evidence that supports your thinking.  You said “As a result of this these girls are not able to play together.  As a result of the segregation laws they are not able to even climb on the fence cause I’m going you see how I’m going back to the text the little girl’s mother says to not even climb on the fence to play with the little white girl.”  Work to teach this more explicitly and then consistently demand that students provide textual evidence to support their thinking.  For example while thinking aloud you might say “Let me go back to the text and see if I can prove that my thinking is correct.  Let me see if I can find a phrase or sentence that tells me that the girls can’t play together.  Oh right here on p. ____ it says ‘GIVE EXACT QUOTE HERE.’”  You could even have the exact quote already written down on a sentence strip and hold or put it up when you model this close reading work.      Later when students were sharing out their own thinking you summarized and said “So as you reviewed these pages of the story you worked together with a partner and this is how you feel that the segregation laws are affecting the two girls Annie and Clover.  Alright okay so Frankie and Luis said that they can’t be friends because of the fence and the laws.  How many people are in agreement with that?  Okay good.”  From here you continued to read each pair’s idea.  Push children to find a word phrase or sentence in the text that proves that the girls can’t be friends. Another good example of a great opportunity to push the students to use text evidence to prove their ideas is when Jakheem and Breanna spoke about Annie’s friends possibly being mad at her because she wanted to play with Clover.  Jakheem said “Annie wanted to play jump rope and they said no so I think they’re mad because um Clover is talking to Annie.”  Here you can push Jakheem to think about a part in the text that makes him think they are mad.  He might cite a picture or a word that is used either by her friends or by the author to describe her friends.    Across groups students had difficulty identifying a cause.  In the case of Jakheem and Frankie they were unable to read far enough to identify a real problem or cause.  When you asked Jakheem “The world what’s going on at that time” he responded appropriately (given what he had read thus far) by saying “At that time nothing’s really happening.  Everything’s really good.”  Yalkiris and Auron incorrectly identified the problem or cause in their book as simply the year 1925.  Breanna’s group was able to think about multiple issues however they had trouble honing in on just one cause and effect pair.  Consider identifying the cause that you want students to focus on for them.  This is essentially what you did during the mini-lesson.  Then for the independent work period they can identify the effects of this issue and locate evidence to support their thinking about the effects that they list.  Ultimately then the mini-lesson active engagement independent work would be aligned.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    A culture of mutual respect and hard work is evident in your classroom.  Both you and the other adults in your classroom treat the students with respect and care.    Next Steps:    Ensure that you are clear about the purpose of each lesson beforehand.  If the need to alter a lesson arises after you have written the lesson plan be sure that you remain focused on what you want students to come away understanding and able to do.    Ensure that you explicitly model the skill strategy habit or process you are teaching during every mini-lesson.       Use your own questions to deepen student thinking rather than to drive the mini-lesson.      When students turn and talk provide a prompt or question that pushes students to explain their ideas or choices.

An attention to academics was evident throughout the classroom.    All adults were being productively utilized with Ms. Gutierrez working with a small group and yourself working with a slightly larger group.    Next Steps    Ensure that all teaching points focus on skills strategies or concepts.    Ensure a clear connection between the modeling/demonstration portion of your lesson and the strategies that students use to complete independent work.    Ensure that students are intellectually engaged at all times.

Your prompts encouraged them to carefully consider each other's ideas and explain their own thoughts.    Next Steps:    Model explicitly all new content skills and strategies.    When assessing ensure that the assessment will accurately assess the concept skill strategy or understanding you want to know about.
0761667,2016,897583,2016-01-06 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You encouraged students to help each other out thereby developing a classroom culture of respect and care.    During the discussion you consistently pushed students to explain their thinking.    You consistently restated students' thoughts during the discussion.      Next Steps:    Always stick to the VTS prompts: "What is going on here?"  and "What more can you say?"    Be sure that you explicitly teach the teaching point.  Use a chart to track your own thinking and process so that students can refer to this resource afterwards.  In this case a chart showing how you took the information from both pictures (e.g. a t-chart showing information gathered from picture #1 and the information gathered from picture #2 and then the synthesized big idea at the top) would be useful.  You could then organize students' work with a similar mini-chart structure.    Be sure that the teaching point is consistent throughout the lesson from the modeling to the active engagement to the independent work.    Make the modeling portion of the mini-lesson succinct and explicit.  This is the "I do" portion of the lesson.
0761667,2016,931334,2016-02-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,-There are many practices in your classroom that continue to make this space a place of learning.  Your students are happy to be in your class and they are usually engaged in very targeted small group work.  I have seen this particualrly in reading and math.  In regards to this lesson (which is writing) I want you to consider the types of supports and scaffolds that are needed and that you can put in place to guide your students through the writing process in a manner that will allow them to build their own ideas and support these ideas with evidence they identify.  Overall what I observed during this lesson was a very guided lesson where you identified the claim and the supporting evidence for each paragraph.  Students as a result were more compliant than actively involved in the thinking and construction of the writing.  The pace was also very quick for some of your students (some were still struggling with recalling the text they would be writing off of).      My recommendation is for you to slow down a little bit and revisit your lesson planning for writing.  Identify what you will do and what your students will do during each part of the lesson.  Also think about the supports that will be in place for each student to do this work.  At the end of the lesson not every student will be at the same place (and this is ok) in the writing but they should all be able to really build on a specific skill well.  One recommendation for students struggling with holding on to the story is providng the text for them and giving them a tool where they can write out the gist of the story.      Next Steps:     -Review your current data and identify where each of your students are developmentally.  Choose one lesson for next week that you will submit where you identify learning targets for groups of studdents (the learning targets may not all be the same but they will be along the continuum of writing the litarary essay).  Then detail what you will do and what individual students (or groups of students) will do during each part of the lesson to meet these targets.  Your tools and possibly your outcome should be differentiated for each of these groups.  Submit the plan for review and feedback and then we can meet to discuss how this has impacted (positively and/or negatively your teaching of the writign lesson.  Let's schedule to meet and discuss the taught lesson and lesson plan during your prep on Friday March 18th.
0761667,2016,964560,2016-04-08 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Overall your classroom runs seamlessly and effortlessly.  Your effective management of the multiple groups and grades in your class is reflective of how well you know your students and their readiness levels.      As noted above you do a very good job of monitoring student learning and keeping yourself informed of where students are developmentally within the lesson.  Your next step is to think deeper about how you are tracking this progress.  It is unclear whether you have a system in place where you track student progress.  If you do there was no evidence during this lesson that you or your additional adults use it to track progress.  Therefore I am asking you to rethink how you track student learning during each lesson.  This may take the form of a checklist or conference notes.  Whichever system you use it should be a tool that is functional and efficient; which means it should be easy to use and time saving yet clearly inform you of what students are and are not able to do by the end of this lesson.  Please let me know what system or tool you are planning to use for any lesson you plan to teach next week.  You can send it via email.  I will provide any feedback as necessary.
0761667,2016,1030107,2016-05-04 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,I am in awe on how you are able to continue to engage all your students in your lessons even when some students may be struggling emotionally.  It is clear your routines and expectations have been shared practiced reinforced and internalized.  Your classroom runs like  well-oiled machine!    As shared at the end of your observation students would benefit from a simple graphic organizer that outlines your teaching point when they go off and work independently or in partnerships.  For example for this specific lesson I recommend that you simply write on post-its "Who and what".  In this way they could write who the section they read was about and what about this who.  There will be times or at least parts of their stories where the problem hasn't yet occurred or the problem has been solved so to only focus on the character and the problem the character is facing may become confusing for them.  Please make this adjustment to this lesson for the future and consider the types of graphic organizers or guiding question you will provide students with once they go off to work independently or in partnerships.  These graphic organizers or guiding questions can also serve as sources of data to measure student progress.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You have established clear routines and expectations during Reading Workshop that enable your children to do a significant amount of reading.    Students demonstrated self-confidence and independence as they read using a variety of strategies to figure out words on their own.    Next Steps:    Prepare yourself to model skills strategies or habits really well during guided reading by taking time to identify places in texts that are very good examples of each skill strategy or habit for each instructional level towards which you will be teaching.
0779828,2015,583756,2015-01-06 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,

For example each time you rang the chime the students raised their hands and were quiet very quickly.    You were thinking about an active way to involve students in critically analyzing their characters.    Next Steps:    Student engagement was very low.  Students were sitting with books closed and unable to explain what they were doing.  During the share portion students were unclear on what they were expected to do and a disproportional amount of time was spent waiting.  As you move forward clearly state directions model the process and provide tools for students to engage with the content throughout the independent work period more easily.    Be sure that you are thoroughly plan all aspects of each lesson including the supports you will provide and the specific small group work or one-to-one conferences that you will conduct.
0779828,2015,709441,2015-03-25 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You were assessing student growth and understanding in multiple ways.  You were assessing students' current reading levels using a running record and comprehension questions.  At the conclusion of the period an exit slip was used to gauge students' understanding of the day's mini-lesson.     Eleven out of 14 students were productively engaged with text throughout the observed reading period.       Next Steps:    Be aware of the types of questions you are asking.  Try to avoid yes/no and either/or questions.  Be sure to plan the wording of your questions ahead of time.    When asking comprehension questions work to ask students the same questions individually.  Take notes on students' responses and compare to the TCRWP reading progression.    Be mindful of where Denise positions herself during independent reading time.  Ensure that she can see all students in order to help them all get right back on track if and when they become distracted or off-task.
0779828,2016,858787,2015-12-03 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your guided reading lessons were well-structured and well-paced.      You thoroughly planned guided reading lessons that addressed the elements of two very different level texts appropriately increasing the focus on comprehension with the level K text.    Your interactions with students demonstrate genuine care and respect for them as human beings.    Both time and human resources were used very productively in your classroom during the observed period.    Next Steps:    Do not interrupt students during guided reading as they are reading aloud to you.  Rather provide time for them to initiate self-corrections.  Take notes on miscues that are not self-corrected and choose one or two to return and teach into when they are done reading to you.    Work to become conscious of when and what types of questions you ask.  Questions can be used to monitor student understanding and initiate or stimulate independent student thinking.  They should not however be used as a teaching method.  A singular line of questioning aimed at producing one particular answer will not yield deep student understanding.    Pay attention to the evidence you are using to assess students.  Jot this evidence down briefly on your notes page.
0779828,2016,923045,2016-01-27 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You thoughtfully planned a guided reading lesson with the following key elements: a book introduction; content vocabulary; and inferential comprehension questions.    You prompted students to double check themselves after figuring out a tricky word.    You prompted students to figure out words on their own by reminding them of strategies.  You did not give students words.      You verbally affirmed when students used effective strategies on their own.    Routines were known to all members of the classroom community.  You and Ms. Garcia have empowered your YMCA day staff member to act as a teacher independently transitioning the class from one thing to another.    You asked inferential comprehension questions and pushed students to cite textual evidence to back up their ideas.    You provided students with vocabulary support at the start of and during the guided reading lesson.    Next Step:    Be aware and take note of all challenges that students have during your small group work with them including comprehension challenges.  Utilize the data you gather (e.g. notes on what happened) to plan targeted teaching points in the future.
0779828,2016,1025293,2016-04-22 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,I have thoroughly enjoyed watching how much your practice has evolved this past school year.  Your pedagogy has truly been impactful to the children in your classroom and I look forward to continue seeing you improve your practice.    At this time the only major concern I would like to address is ensuring that the instructional supports provided to your students should be present throughout the process of learning; however you should not provide teacher support during the actual performance tasks.  It is perfectly fine to review the instructions modify questions and/or tasks modify the materials used during the performance task but avoid going over question by question and telling students to erase their incorrect responses to then work together to answer it correctly.  This will ultimately lead to complaint students and not necessarily students knowledgable of the concepts being taught/explored.
0779828,2016,1014806,2016-05-16 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You explicitly introduced the day's work.    You explicitly modeled how to take a sneak peek at a book and then categorize it according to its main topic.    Next Steps:    Start all planning and lessons by naming for yourself and for the students the teaching point and the reason for the teaching point.  See example given in Component 1e (P&P).    Limit the duration of your mini-lesson to 10 - 15 minutes.    Ensure that you have planned purposefully for the independent work that students will do.
0818987,2014,112466,2013-11-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,CRUZ JESSICA,- The mini lesson lasted 29 minutes which resulted in students not having an opportunity to engage in the planned independent work.  During our post-observation conference you did explain this would be continued in the next lesson. One suggestion for you is to use a timer to monitor the amount of time spent on your mini lesson. In addition when designing your mini lesson ensure you are truly modeling the strategy explicitly before you have students try it out with you. In other words ensure you are following the "I do we do you do" model and that you are modeling the thinking on your own during the "I do" portion before eliciting participation from your students. In this manner your instructions will be explicit and you will have more time/opportunity to listen in to your students trying it out in partnerships.    - During our post observation conference you indicated one of your struggles (and an area you wish to work on) is the length of your mini lesson. As you explained your hesitancy to let your students go on their own stems from your uncertainty of whether they truly "got it" as well as from your students’ need for reminders and redirection of the task once they leave the meeting area. One idea we discussed was putting a reminder post card on students' desks that gives them one or two general instructions to refocus them. One possible instruction reads "reread the teaching point". This tool will allow your students to begin to move away from their dependency on your constant support and will help refocus them on the task independently. Another idea is the gradual release of responsibility. Based on a quick check in during the "we do" portion of the mini lesson you could identify which students to send back to their tables and which to keep on the carpet. In addition some of these decisions could also be anticipated prior to the lesson based on prior formative assessments and what you know of your students' readiness levels.     - One last idea we discussed for quickly assessing your students understanding and readiness levels is to use a checklist of the skills or strategies you expect to see that demonstrate understanding and independence of the specific teaching point. As you walk around to monitor your students and confer with them you can quickly check off who is using the skill or strategy taught and who is not. This way you can obtain a quick read of your class as will as of individual students.  Let’s meet again the week of December 2nd to discuss your revised method of assessment and data collection.  I want to make sure it is a system that works for you and your students.
0818987,2014,143607,2013-12-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,The text you chose to read is filled with sophisticated vocabulary and is cognitively challenging for your second graders.  This shows that your instructional choices are made with the intentions of exposing your students to learning experiences that encourage higher level thinking.  Your students sat around and listened to you read aloud to them occasionally stopping to ask them questions about the text.       While read alouds are an opportunity to expose your students to text for enjoyment it is a great opportunity to model and practice good reading/thinking/talking habits.  Plan your next read aloud with specific questions that engage students in thinking about the text while trying out/practicing strategies taught.     The end of your read aloud seemed rushed or lacking a wrap up of sorts which made the learning expectation a bit unclear. (e.g. "What do you think Dr. Dorean is thinking right now?" Student responds "Ok boys and girls I'm going to give you a math page for homework.  Back to your seats") Ensure that at the end of your read aloud there is a sense of closure before moving on to the dismissal procedures where you address whatever thinking strategy you were modeling in the read aloud or accountable talk strategies or even a thinking prompt that will push them to continue to think deeper about the text.  Likewise while the read aloud may not be a conventional lesson where you are teaching a strategy guiding them through the practice and then having them try it out on their own it should still be used as a learning opportunity where students are practicing the strategies taught in previous lessons.  In this way you can maximize your instructional time.      First grade's pedagogy focus group's inquiry is around how to make the read aloud more effective as an instructional period.  It would be helpful to meet with one of the first grade teacher's to obtain strategies they are trying out.  I also suggest identifying a question or a strategy you want students to explore during your read aloud and making it explicit in your plans and in your delivery (particularly during the wrap up).
0818987,2014,247918,2014-03-24 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the informal feedback that I sent to you via email on March 24 2014:    When I arrived the class was working on handwriting and the spelling of compound words in their Fundations writing workbooks.  The class was quiet and focused throughout the entire observed period.  All students were seated.  There was no student misbehavior at all.     When I arrived and throughout the observed period the YMCA staff member and the new substitute paraprofessional were actively circulating around the room to assist various students.  The paraprofessional did keep close proximity to Malik and sometimes checked in with Axel.     Consider how you can utilize the more steady assistance (YMCA) to plan a small group during this time.  For example I noticed that Joshua was not utilizing the lines properly as he wrote.  By looking at student work ahead of time you could identify a small group of students (2 - 3) who needs work on correctly using the 4 lines provided to form their letters.  The YMCA assistant could be charged with working with them on this showing them how to use the top line middle line etc. as guides.  Joshua received no help on handwriting while I was there though this was something with which he was clearly struggling.  Consider using extra help like YMCA for this type of targeted and pre-planned small group work.  I know that behavior doesn't always allow for this but in this instance it was possible.     Students transitioned quickly and easily to the rug at the end of the Fundations period.  There was a clear routine for getting water as evidenced by the way one student got a drink and the next student in line waited at the corner of the sink rather than crowding the student who was drinking.     Be aware of the content.  Students suggested words like race car as compound words that are not actually compound words.  Their suggestions however were affirmed.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You asked questions that pushed Nicole to explain her thinking as well as questions that encouraged Nicole to reflect upon the strategies she used.    Nicole had a strong grasp of multiple strategies and employed them easily with limited to no prompting from you or requests for assistance.  Nicole demonstrated self-confidence and risk-taking.    You took observation notes that specify specifically what happened.    Next Steps:    Regularly inform classroom teachers of the two - five sight words that are most important for the students to learn in order to progress to the next level.  Collaboratively decide upon a goal date for the student to have mastered these words.    Engage your colleagues in cycles of observation.    Continue working to transition Nicole and other students who are transitioning out of Reading Recovery in their classrooms.
0818987,2015,750229,2015-05-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    It is evident that you are transferring all that you learned in your Reading Recovery coursework to the work that you do in other contexts such as the observed Leveled Literacy group.    You consistently gave students short focused reminders that encouraged them to implement appropriate reading strategies.    Your rapport with students was genuinely caring and respectful.    You asked students comprehension questions and pushed them to explain and support their answers.    You took ample individualized notes on each students' progress during each part of the lesson.    Next Steps:    Continue to grow your professional work with teachers in both the 1st and 2nd grades.  With Ms. Khan develop a weekly schedule of 10 minute sit-in times for each classroom as well as a bi-weekly meeting time with each grade level to discuss imperative instructional levers and non-negotiable student reading behaviors.  I would like to see you both begin this work in September.
0818987,2016,852191,2015-10-29 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You demonstrated a deep understanding of effective reminding prompts and other tactile and visual strategies aimed at deep learning.    You were strategic about when you prompted Branny or taught into particular miscues or strategies.  You were conscious about balancing praise as a reinforcement strategy reminding prompts and new strategy teaching.    You recognized and taught into Branny's specific needs during all parts of the session.  It was evident that you were constantly trying to push him to the next level.    Assessment is a continuous fully embedded part of your daily practice.      Next Steps:    Develop a plan to check-in and work directly with the ENL (English as a New Language) teachers to develop plans of action for the students you have in common such as Branny.  There are elements of grammar letter-sound correspondence and vocabulary for example that the ENL teachers could systematically work on with Branny as you are working on reading strategies.  However in order to develop and follow through with a comprehensive and individualized plan for each of the students that you share regular meeting and planning is necessary.
0818987,2016,923043,2016-01-21 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You worked to balance giving some wait time and then giving the word when it was impeding comprehension.  You always came back to the words that posed a problem at the end of the book.    I love that Katelynn prepares her own seat at the beginning of each session!  This gives her the opportunity to be responsible for her own learning!    Next Step:    Work to explicitly problem solve with children bringing them into the process of setting goals and taking steps to work towards their own improvement.  For example Katelyn looks up at you a lot.  You worked to balance ignoring her and  responding to her with a prompt.  Might this be something you should address some day explicitly?  For example you could say “Katelyn I notice that sometimes you look up at me when you are unsure of a word.  Sometimes when you look up at me you wait for me to respond and sometimes you go back and try again all by yourself with all the strategies you know.  Of course when you are in your classroom or at home I am not able to be with you when you are reading so I really want you to always be in the habit of trying your own strategies rather than looking up at me for help.  So when we read together I want you to try not to look up at me for help when you are in here."
0818987,2016,983616,2016-04-19 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,After reviewing your lesson plan I started to wonder whether or how you share some of this information with classroom teachers.  It is a topic we should discuss a bit further during our CST meetings and will be on the agenda for our next meeting.  Please come prepared with either your current system or possible ideas for how to streamline communication about students receiving services between teachers and service providers.
0818987,2016,1036000,2016-05-27 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,
0818987,2017,1096946,2016-11-21 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You consistently provided opportunities for Jacob to struggle with the work thereby building his stamina perseverance and self-correction strategies.  At the same time after providing Jacob sufficient time to struggle you quickly gave him the unknown words (sees; she).    You explicitly pointed out how hard Jacob worked multiple times most noticeably following the Little Chimp text.  In this way you positively reinforced his perseverance.    You named the strategies that Jacob used successfully (e.g. " You reread you tried to skip it….and then you went back and thought about what would make sense and you fixed it.")     You kept a quick pace throughout moving Jacob from one instructional activity to the next maximizing his time reading writing and practicing explicit strategies.    You provided a safe reinforcing positive learning environment for Jacob thereby demonstrating genuine care and respect for him as a learner.    Next Step:    Continue to work with and support other teachers as they learn how to conduct on-the-spot running records using Marie Clay's notations.  During inquiry team meetings review teachers' running records talking through the notations they used and helping them to analyze for different types of errors.  In addition it would be great if you could publicly offer yourself as a resource to the staff (perhaps via email) as teachers conduct and analyze running records this year.

0875870,2014,116199,2014-01-07 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,CRUZ JESSICA,While you conferred with each student in your group you did not take any conference notes tracking their progress with the skills/strategies you worked on.  In fact when working with Nova on building fluency while reading the text you corrected his miscues rather than conducting a quick running record identifying his miscues tracking his speed and accuracy and using this information to establish goals and next steps.  In addition you conferred with Alisson who demonstrated some struggle with keeping track of her main ideas and details since her text was longer but you did not document your conference nor did you develop a next step with her that would cognitively push her.  Rather her next step was "tomorrow we will finish yours because yours was longer."      While it is evident you are being strategic with the work you are doing with your students you do need to develop the pedagogical practice and habit of regularly taking conference/observational/anecdotal notes to monitor student progress and determine next steps.  I am attaching a conference template for you to review.  Feel free to modify to meet your needs and bring with you during our post-observation conference scheduled for Tuesday January 21st.  If you already have a template please bring it with you to the conference.
0875870,2014,241540,2014-04-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,You need to develop clear plans for your groups detailing the skills/strategies you will be working on during your lesson.  At the end of this observation when I asked you for your lesson plan you handed me Ms. Gabbard's plan and highlighted the bottom of the lesson plan where she identified what the small group work was.  Please note that this is just a synopsis of what the task should be during small group work and what these students need assistance with; however it is not a plan for the entire lesson for your specific students.  When Ms. Gabbard or (other teachers) email you unit frameworks and lessons for the day it is your responsibility to review it and devise your own plan for how to tackle the overall lesson's goal for your assigned students.  This includes the development and preparation of resources that can support your learners.  Your plan should include a mini-lesson (or review) guided practice and independent work (follow the I do we do you do model which is part of the workshop model).  If your intent is for students to be part of the whole class mini-lesson then you should engage with Ms. Gabbard in one of the co-teaching models so that you are both actively involved in instructing monitoring and assessing student learning.  This is an area in your practice that needs attention.  This is why Ms. Bowen has been assigned to work with you.  I am also assigning Ms. Mair from the network to provide you with support in planning and preparation.      I also highly suggest you reconfigure your students' seats for when you do push in work.  During today's lesson the three students you service were seated in three different spots throughout the room which did not allow you an opportunity to model the strategy have them try it out together talk it out and then try it out on their own.  This will also help you with your time management so you are not constantly walking around the room touching base or checking in with students but rather are being very targeted and intentional in your support and your instruction.

0875870,2015,526800,2014-11-05 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Component 3b continued: For example you could put one or two sentence starters on the board (When I read I am going to work on... AND I will practice this by...).  Students could use these starters to talk briefly in partnerships.  Then a whole class discussion could be held with the teachers facilitating the use of talk prompts like these: "My goal is similar to yours because..." "My goal is different because..." "I am also going to work on that but I was thinking about a different strategy..."  "That is a good idea.  Can you explain how you will try to reach your goal?" In this way you can work towards a more authentic conversation that requires children to do the bulk of the thinking.    Highlights:    You prepared a lovely visual for the students that mapped out the ideal reading journey during the course of the year.  Consider how you might be able to make this interactive throughout the year.    You utilized students' prior knowledge about and experience with the marathon to help them understand the kind of tenacity and focus on reading stamina and volume that they must have in order to move forward as readers.      Next Steps:    When planning begin by clearly identifying the teaching point.  Then ensure that all elements of the lesson align to this teaching point.    Use the mini-lesson portion of the lesson to model (and/or think aloud about) a skill strategy or habit.      Ensure that when planning you consider the supports you need to provide all some and a few students in order for them to intellectually engage in the lesson's content.      Both teachers must play an active role in the planning and execution of all lessons.  No one person should be assigned to "teach" a particular subject. While one person can be in charge of the initial planning for each subject both you and Ms. Adams are responsible for teaching all subjects and therefore  must both be a part of the planning process for all subjects.  This could mean that one person is planning the lesson's skeleton and then the other person is altering contributing adding etc. via email or other communication methods that don't require face-to-face time.    Pose questions that require students to think independently.  Avoid asking questions that ask children to repeat what a teacher has said.    Monitor student understanding of the teaching point and adjust your teaching as necessary.
0875870,2015,613732,2015-02-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    The modeling and active engagement portions of the workshop were clear and well-aligned to the teaching point.    Both Ms. Adams and Ms. Stoney were productively working one-on-one with students during the mini-lesson and during the independent work period.    You are actively following through with the plans that you Ms. Adams and Anne Palmer (TCICP) made together.    Next Steps:    Shorten the amount of time spent turning and talking so that you do not lose students' focus.  To foster more student talk ask several turn and talk questions but decrease the amount of time spent on each one.    Assign writing work during reading workshop only for students reading at Level K and above.    Make the link from the mini-lesson to the independent work period more succinct.  Give directions for independent work just once.    Work to engage more students in whole class discussions.
0875870,2015,695966,2015-03-26 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You used the Elmo during the mini-lesson and share.  This allowed all students to see the text easily as you were demonstrating the strategies.  The use of the Elmo really allowed for an authentic model of the strategy.    All parts of your lesson were clearly aligned to the lesson's teaching point.  You continuously returned to the teaching point explicitly reiterating it.    There are clear routines and structures in place during your reading workshop including pre-reading goal-setting guided and shared reading and "favorite book/favorite place" reading time.  All children were well-aware of these routines and transitioned seamlessly throughout the reading period.  This enabled time to be utilized extremely well and teaching and learning time to be maximized.    During the course of the observed period children spent 31 minutes productively interacting with texts.  By offering children various ways to interact with text (including independent reading of leveled books independent choice reading time guided reading shared reading one-to-one read aloud (Ms. Stoney)) you were able to sustain student focus and develop students' reading stamina.    Next Steps:    Be aware of the reading seats that children are assigned to or take.  In some cases student focus may make it necessary for you to assign a student to sit elsewhere during independent reading time.    Develop a system for what students can do with the mini-charts after the day that you teach the strategy so that they can utilize them effectively and independently afterwards.    Pre-Observation Conference:  We held a pre-observation conference on March 19 2015.  During our meeting we discussed the context for your lesson the alternate lead teaching schedule that you and Ms. Adams have in place and the actual strategy that you were intending to teach (Triple Check Strategy).    Post-Observation Conference:  We held a post-observation conference on March 27 2015.  During this meeting you reflected on the lesson stating that the children were engaged and that you had used the share portion of the lesson as an assessment of student understanding.
0875870,2015,759998,2015-05-05 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,
0875870,2016,833631,2015-12-03 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    The prompts and questions you asked evidence your understanding of early reading acquisition.    Your interactions with students evidence your own genuine care and respect for them.    It was clear that time is treated as a precious resource in your classroom.  You were purposeful and efficient with your use of time.    Students engaged in a large amount of reading time.  They read independently in guided reading groups and in partnerships.  This variety of reading structures yielded 30 minutes of sustained and engaged reading from all students.    Next Steps:    When planning for guided reading develop a book introduction that includes the book's title the main character's name a brief summary of part of the story and a "read to find out" prompt that is broad enough to encompass the majority of the text.    When planning plan to quickly introduce new vocabulary yourself and to provide vocabulary support (e.g. a picture) to which students can refer throughout the guided reading lesson.     When listening to students read independently do not interrupt them during their reading to prompt or correct.  Rather work to record their miscues on your notes page and then choose 1 - 3 miscues to teach into when you are done listening in.
0875870,2016,923044,2016-01-21 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You read the book Earrings with so much verbal emphasis and body language that helped the students to comprehend.  For example you put your hands out in front of you and gestured to add emphasis when the main character was saying how much she wanted the earrings.  Your voice changed to express the main character's feelings.  You also voiced over with your thoughts as the reader when you were reading aloud.  This both served to model your thinking as a reader and help the students comprehend.  For example you whispered "These are things she needs to do anyway" and "Doesn't she need to do this anyway?  That's what I'm thinking" while reading in the main character's voice all the things she would do to get the earrings.    You had students take a stand - literally - when you asked the class their predictions about the parents' next moves.  This was a great way to involve all students.  It forced all students to think rather than letting a few answer the question.  You then asked all students to talk to their partners sharing their reasons.  This was followed by a brief class share of reasons.    You worked to push students to support their answers and ideas.  For example at one point you said "But sometimes just wanting something is not enough so...what's something she said?  What is something that she had said that's a good reason she should get it?"    Next Steps:    Be mindful of how much wait time you provide students after you ask a question.  You often asked a question and looked for an answer (or hands up) within a second or two.  Remember the reading we did which emphasized the ten second wait time rule. This will give more students a chance to think and formulate their ideas ultimately getting more students involved in the conversation.  So to make time you made need to stop a little less during the read aloud and then provide good wait time when you ask those open-ended questions.    Ensure that all lesson plans begin with a clear and specific teaching point and that all aspects of the plan are explicitly linked to the lesson's teaching point.  When executing lessons be sure that the purpose of the lesson and the teaching point is made clear and explicit throughout the lesson.
0875870,2016,1004262,2016-04-04 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You engaged students with high energy and resources that all could see.    Students independently demonstrated care and respect for one another.      Next Steps:    Ensure that all lessons have clear teaching points and that you explicitly articulate the goals and purpose of the lesson to students at the start of the lesson.
0875870,2016,1035994,2016-05-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Overall your questioning was engaging and did indeed elicit student thinking and problem solving.  Moving forward your next step is to continue working on using your questioning to facilitate conceptual understanding.  For example at one point you asked "Does knowing if I have 3 green markers help me know how many I have in all?"  Students responded "no".  I was looking to see you ask a question that required them to think about the why behind what you were getting at; a question like "What happens if I have 3 green 4 red and 10 yellow markers?  Can I make even bundles?  How can I use (or can I use) my doubling rule if I don't have even number of markers?    I thoroughly enjoyed this lesson.   Keep up the good work.
0879487,2014,181888,2014-02-28 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the informal feedback that I sent to you via email on March 3 2014:    When I arrived students were just being dismissed from the carpet area.  They were dismissed at 10:24.  By 10:27 both you and Audrey were working with small groups.  You have a system and schedule in place for small group work and appeared to be following that schedule.     You worked with four students on the rug. You did not take any notes during the reading group.  You worked individually with students as they read their independent books.  I see your lesson plan states that the teaching point was that readers reread their books.  Please refer to the TC guide for guided reading and small groups that aligns skills strategies and habits with each reading level as you plan and instruct (I have attached it to this email).  You should be very aware of what readers on each level should be working on and both your planning instruction and notes should reflect this work.  In addition please utilize shared texts for guided reading.     There was little management of students' independent reading.  Although you and Audrey were both working with groups just three minutes after students were released from the carpet at no time did either of you count down or expect students to be reading in their seats.  At 10:27 when you and Audrey were seated with groups the room was extremely loud.  Analee was running around the classroom.  Seven other students were up walking around.  Seven other students were sitting at their seats but none of these students were reading.  Three students were at the back carpet book shopping.  At 10:28 Ms. Johnson was at the door trying to get three students who were standing up there back to their seats.  At 10:29 seven students were standing up and it was very loud.  At 10:30 six students were walking around the room and Juanita was reading aloud in almost a yelling voice.  You did get up at this point to try to engage some students.  At 10:31 six students were reading independently and four students were up and moving about the room.  Ms. Stoney yelled to a student at a table across from her "Can you stop doing that?"  At 10:32 you sat down with your group on the rug.  Four students were walking/running around the room.  Ms. Stoney yelled to one of the students who was running around "Aren't you supposed to be reading?  So why are you making trouble instead?"  Then five students were up and yelling at each other.       By the end of this week please put the following into place:     At the start of the independent reading period you must have a routine in place for getting started before you begin your work with small groups.  For example you could set a timer for one minute after students are dismissed from the rug and set the expectation that students are all seated and reading by that time.  You could do the same by counting down visibly on your fingers.  There are several possibilities.  You will need to choose one and then explicitly teach it to your students and then repeatedly practice it.     Please ensure that you are tracking whole class reading stamina.  At the start of the year classes were consciously building the amount of time that they were independently reading each day.  This should continue as the year progresses.  Please return to this.

0879487,2014,339358,2014-04-24 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the feedback with which I provided you during our post-observation conference that was held on April 28 2014:    Highlights    The song you used to get students’ attention as you moved into the mini-lesson was developmentally appropriate and calming.  Students readily took part in the singing of “Open Shut Them.”     You and Ms. Hildebrand did a nice job duet teaching for the modeling portion of the mini-lesson.  You had clearly planned out exactly what each of you would say so that the students could see you both thinking aloud about what you might learn as you read the non-fiction text.    You provided the students with a helpful chart that included pictures and minimal text.  The chart listed the steps that they would take as they previewed and predicted.    You took notes during the guided reading lesson tracking Tyana’s skills and habits.  However I did not see Ms. Hildebrand taking any notes.  How do you know what students were able to do during the independent reading time?  How will you hold on to that information as you plan for future instruction?    To Work On as You Move Forward    It is imperative that you and Audrey take control of the room at all times.  At the start of the mini-lesson Shawn was in the back of the room playing around with Jaylin.  Ms. Johnson was struggling to calm the two of them down.  You and Audrey began the mini-lesson and seemed to ignore the scene that was occurring at the back of the room.  It became so loud at points that I could neither hear you and Audrey well nor focus on what you were trying to say.  Work hard not to start or continue a lesson if the classroom is not calm and all students are not focused.  Your expectations for all students must be that they are engaged.    You provided time for students to talk with partners however three students sat without partners during the turn and talk.  You did not check that everyone had a partner but rather immediately listened in with another partnership.  During the turn and talk these three students as well as one other pair sat silently and did not talk at all.  Be sure to check in with everyone to make sure that they are prepared to talk before giving the class the go ahead to talk.    You set the timer when students went back to their seats however when the timer went off no teacher said anything to the class.  Students were still talking though no one was out of their seats a great improvement since my last observation in your classroom.  When the timer goes off be sure to notice who is seated and reading.  You can tap those who are not yet reading as a reminder.    During the independent reading time the table adjacent to your guided reading table was very loud.  I turned around and spoke to them.  They were silent the rest of the period.  However prior to this neither you nor Ms. Hildebrand intervened.  Please work to be aware of disruptions and off-task behavior so that you can stop it immediately and make the work time more productive.

0879487,2015,516694,2014-10-22 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You pushed the students to write more and be independent in both their decision-making about the course their writing would take and their use of supplies.     The lesson was well-structured with a coherent mini-lesson that included you modeling and an active engagement and independent work time.    You consistently utilized Responsive Classroom teacher language.    Three students demonstrated confidence and self-sufficiency consistently relying on each other and themselves as resources.    Next Steps    During the active engagement portion of the lesson work to engage all students.  This is a time that is likely difficult for shy students or students who have difficulty with verbal directions.  Consider: a) pairing shy students with peers with whom they are socially comfortable and b) using tangible tools to help students know what to do and discuss during the active engagement.  For example you could provide some pairs with blank how-to books and ask them to touch each page and rehearse what they will write.  Without this tangible support the task may seem very abstract and difficult.  You could also or alternately create a simple chart with pictures showing what the partnerships should do.     Work to build in quick whole class assessments following the mini-lesson using a gradual release method.  For example you can ask the whole class to think about their plan for the period.  Ask them to name the topic they are going to work on and what their first steps for the day will be.  As you dismiss from the rug ask your highest performers first and dismiss quickly after hearing their responses.  Next ask your middle group.  Dismiss them to work independently if their answers demonstrate security and hold on the rug briefly if their answers demonstrate insecurity.  Finally ask the group you anticipate might be most confused.  This should be a quick process.  For students who have difficulty naming their plans spend 2 - 3 minutes reviewing the goals yourself or ask Cody to gather them for a quick review of the work they are to do.
0879487,2015,635171,2015-03-04 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You were working to engage students in thoughtful assessment of their classmates' published book reviews.    Next Steps:    Throughout the course of any given writing unit work in explicit teaching points related to self and peer assessment focusing on how to identify strategies that have been taught and that the writer is in turn successfully employing.      Ensure that you have a well-planned mini-lesson for everything including celebrations.  Don't assume that children know how to self-reflect and peer-assess well.  Rather this is very cognitively challenging work that takes explicit instruction and lots of practice (more than the end of each unit).
0879487,2015,670988,2015-03-18 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:     Your written lesson plan is specific and aligned.  You thought about the text you would use as well as the specific sentences of the book that you would use to demonstrate.    You explicitly named the strategy at the beginning and end of the mini-lesson.    You were aware of lesson pacing both when you wrote the lesson plan and when you were actually teaching.    You consistently invite student voice.    Next Steps:    Ensure that students know how to effectively utilize the daily reading goal sheets with which you have provided them.  Be sure that you are consistently analyzing their sheets to understand if and how they are using the goal sheets.  Follow-up accordingly with individual conferences or small group strategy lessons.    Ensure that the pictures on your charts and on the bookmarks or other mini-charts effectively communicate what the strategy actually involves.      Pre-Observation Conference: We met for a pre-observation conference on March 12 2015.  During our meeting you discussed the reading unit that you were currently engaged in and the work that students would be doing in the days leading up to the observed lesson.  You highlighted the book that you were planning to use to model the Triple Check strategy citing both the level and the topic of space.    Post-Observation Conference: We met for a post-observation conference on March 19 2015.  At this meeting you reflected on the lesson noting that you felt the modeling went well and that students were engaged during the mini-lesson.  You reflected on the challenge of instilling in your students the need to "listen and learn" during the modeling portion of the mini-lesson rather than quickly answer the question.  During our meeting you noted that you made a conscious decision to move on when it became apparent that the students did not understand the question "Does it sound right?"  Most significantly we discussed the need to teach each of the three questions/strategies in isolation before bringing them altogether in one lesson.  We agreed that the question with which students had the most difficulty was "Does that sound right?" or "Does that sound like a book?"  As a next step you planned to reach out to Angela and discuss methods for teaching that question at your next labsite day.

0879487,2016,852183,2015-11-04 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your language reinforced student care and cooperation.    You deliberately took time to remind students how to use materials and in this way ensured smooth productive work with the white boards.    Students were intellectually engaged with the work of stretching out tricky words listening to every sound.  Students easily took risks trying various spellings on their white boards and thought carefully about all the sounds they heard.    You willingly open your classroom to visitors outside of our school building and share your own practice thoughtfully and humbly with others.      Next Step:    You are extremely mindful of the need to remind students of routines and procedures.  During this observation you dedicated time to reminding students about the proper use of materials.  You reminded students by asking questions such as "Who can remind us what's one of the rules we have when we write on the white boards?"  Following this question you asked four more reminding questions.  When reminding students consider multiple ways of reminding such as providing a chart or simply showing and telling students (e.g. I want to remind you that when we are using our white board markers the cap is on the top of the marker like this.).  Doing this in lieu of or in combination with one or two reminding questions could reduce the amount of time spent on reminding.
0879487,2016,922956,2016-01-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,We met for a pre-observation conference on January 11 2016.  We met for a post-observation conference on January 14 2016.    Highlights:    Your lesson plan is thorough and demonstrates careful thinking about how you will model the concept and support students through different modalities.  Your lesson plan is aligned to the teaching point throughout.      During the lesson you modeled the concept clearly and returned to the teaching point and strategy throughout both the mini-lesson and the independent work.    You engaged your students in "Just Right games" for the first time.      You consistently used effective teacher language and tone demonstrating immense care and respect for your students.  You also interactively modeled when necessary.    Students were extremely engaged.  Several demonstrated ownership of the strategies and an ability to take initiative to utilize resources and implement learned strategies on their own.    Students were consistently encouraged to explain their reasoning.    Your professionalism permeates all that you do at P.S. 154.      Next Steps:    Work to address students' disagreements directly in order to minimize the distraction it causes them during instructional time.    Consider how you can use Ms. Cody during math independent work to conduct differentiated small group work.  Reach out to Ms. Rosado or Ms. Gabbard for ideas and to develop an understanding of how they provide their adult City Year helpers with specific small group plans.    Take note of how long students are in the "Take a break" chairs.  Assign Cody to set her own timer or be mindful of when students are calm and prepared to come back.  This allows you to continue to teach knowing that she'll be monitoring how long students stay there.
0879487,2016,983845,2016-03-31 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    All students were engaged in the writing process.  You utilized Ms. Cody effectively to help students write peer feedback.  This station was appropriately scaffolded with possible starters given on sentence strips.    Students knew how to and utilized the classroom as a resource.    Students demonstrated attentiveness to one another as writers.    Next Steps:    Prepare for at least two student conferences per day as you would prepare for a small writing strategy group.  For conferences you are unable to plan for take time to read student writing before starting the conference so that you can get a quick sense of and teach into their needs as efficiently as possible.
0879487,2016,1002518,2016-05-05 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Allison this was a wonderful lesson to observe.  You did a beautiful job integrating targeted intervention within the bigger purpose of your writing lesson.  You also provided explicit instruction and repeated practice opportunities for the students you worked with.  I am thoroughly enjoying watching you continue to grow your practice and bridge the art and science of teaching.
0879487,2017,1086846,2016-11-01 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,POOLMAN BETHANY,It was a pleasure to watch your class ‘buzzing’ about action words and thinking about how to break down the concept of tying shoe laces for the model on the rug.  Students were excited to engage in the appropriately challenging task of describing this skill.  The physical shoe model was an important and helpful representation for those students who needed it.  You clearly thought through your plan and had prepared for various levels of writing skill in tackling the ‘How To’ task.  You understand the necessary and sequential learning activities that build towards the completion of the whole and you appropriately assess your students in these progressions of learning.  Well done.    As we already discussed the only breakdown in the lesson occurred when students were asked to turn and talk about changing the action words ‘pull’ and ‘make’.  When you teach this unit again be sure to slow down here and potentially break this lesson into two separate skills.  First be sure to see that students can accurately identify the action words.  Once that is clear teach the skill of replacing weak or vague action words.  Moving forward try to use this sort of lens when thinking about future lessons.  That is what specific skill do I want my students to do by the end of this lesson?  What will I do to model and practice that specific skill?

Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),COVIELLO ALISON,Although I asked for your lesson plan for this Fundations lesson plan in emails sent January 26th and 27th they were never forwarded to me.  For this reason I was unable to rate much of Domain 1.      Please see the email feedback that I sent you on January 27th below:    Your classroom environment is one that exudes calm and attention to the school work at hand.  During the period that I observed there was no misbehavior.  All students were focused on the learning.  You demonstrated care and respect in all your interactions with your students thereby creating a peaceful and happy classroom culture.    As you move forward please think about the following two items:     1) Although Fundations is a scripted program there were several opportunities to engage more students in the thinking by asking students to work with partners periodically rather than always sticking to the teacher/whole class call-and-response format.  For example when asking students to tap out words or to identify the first or last letter sound you could ask them to do this in pairs.  This invites more students to engage than when simply one student is called upon.    2) Work to develop some type of easy checklist that you can utilize during daily Fundations and SuperKids work time.  In this case you could simply check off which students are successfully identifying the first and last letter sounds and using short a correctly to spell cvc words.  You walked around the room quite readily.  Use this time as an opportunity to formally take note of who is getting what.  This way you can tailor your instruction the next day (e.g. have Tiffany work with a small group that is not ready to go forward OR provide a different activity for those few students who still need first and last letter sound recognition).

0891324,2014,114130,2013-11-25 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,CRUZ JESSICA,Throughout your lesson (mini lesson and partner work) students were engaged in discussions with their peers that were centered on math and the task presented to them.  Students were given over 25 minutes to work together and discuss possible ways to solve the problem they were presented with while you circulated and coached.  While some low-level questions were asked in order to build foundation many questions posed encouraged students to start thinking deeper about the math and their thinking process.  When using Bloom’s Taxonomy to assess the types of questions students were being asked during this lesson 16% of your questions were higher-order thinking questions and 53% of your questions asked them to go beyond just remembering or recalling information and facts.  In order to continue to build on your already strong practice I suggest you think of places in your lesson/unit where students will be encouraged/asked to question each other’s process and critique the efficiency of their own strategies a bit more.  While I know a lot of this happens in the math congress strategically creating thinking and talking opportunities  that lead them to create new ideas or solutions to the task draw conclusions or make connections to other mathematical concepts will prepare them to be better equip to engage in rich conversations during the math congress.      Considering your lesson was an investigation the outcome of the lesson was fairly open-ended. Through this lesson you were assessing how students tackled the problem and what strategies they used to work it out. In your directions you explicitly stated that the goal was for them to use efficient strategies. However when students went to work many of them relied on repeated addition. Through your questioning techniques you tried to guide them to think of other strategies that would be more efficient. Reviewing what an efficient strategy is at the beginning of the lesson could have redirected students from the onset rather than when you worked with them individually. Considering that during investigations lessons you are assessing the process more than the product please be sure to review what makes strategies efficient before students go off to work.      During our pre and post conference conversations you explained your rationale for not providing manipulatives for certain students from the onset. Given your students' readiness levels; however these supports may have allowed them to access the content with greater ease thereby providing the opportunity to be equally successful as those who don't need to rely on manipulatives to visualize or experience the task more concretely.   Midway into the lesson you provided manipulatives for a few partnerships. Consider this modification from the onset for specific students so that they may be able to access and engage successfully in the learning task.
0891324,2014,196434,2014-03-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the feedback that I sent to you via email on March 16 2014:    When I arrived the class was on the rug reviewing problems from the day's work.    You expected and encouraged students to utilize proper mathematical language.  For example you stopped Alimata and said to her "Let's use our math terms Alimata.  This is the what?"  Alimata responded "The denominator."  In order to solidify student understanding of the denominator you then said "And the denominator is telling us what?"  While going over a subsequent problem you said "Alright so the last one we're going over is number 4.  So when I call on you to give me your answer I want you to give me your math words."    You actively monitored student engagement and focus.  During the share you said "All eyes should be on me.  Raymond Jonathan.  All eyes should be on me."  This was an improvement from the last time I was in your classroom when several students were not focused on the lesson and you seemed not to notice and thus made no effort to gain their attention.    Work to summarize the new learning that occurred during the day's lesson during or at the end of the share period.  After going over the problems you stated "Okay so now we’re ready.  Everyone close your books.  Table monitors collect the books.  Okay boys and girls remember I told you that we were going to ST Math so you guys could work on your percentages so you guys are lining up."  While I know and appreciate that you were attentive to the time and eager to make use of as much of it as possible to engage students in ST Math work be sure to always provide students with some sense of closure as well.  You could either say something like "Today we were given some of the information about various scenarios.  We were told how many items made up a fraction of the whole and then we had to figure out how many items were in the whole group.  Tomorrow we'll build off of this work by thinking about..."  OR you could say to students "In two minutes you and your partner need to write one good sentence about what you learned today.  When you're done place your post-it note on the front board."  Then you could use these post-it notes to assess how well students actually understood what they were doing.

It was evident that students are in the habit of working and talking about the math on a regular basis (e.g. even groups that had no adult present maintained the conversation about the math investigation).  Your interactive board with questions and responses posed by students demonstrates your efforts toward building independent critical thinkers.  I look forward to seeing how you continue to build the love for math and mathematical thinking in your classroom.
0891324,2015,524274,2014-10-20 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,While it is not expected that you plan a full lesson for your read aloud consider including the following in your reading lesson plan: text to be used for read aloud connection/s you intend on making to either reading or writing workshop lessons planned discussion prompt/s and how you will quickly assess or get a temperature check at the end of your read aloud.  In this way it is clearer how you intend on using the read aloud to further the exposure and development of understanding of skills and strategies taught in your literacy workshops.
0891324,2015,573122,2014-12-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your classroom speaks to your focus on establishing good independent reading habits.    Over time your class is closely following the actions of Marvin the main character in your read aloud text.  In this way there is continuity over time.  You established a focus for the read aloud time at the start of the read aloud period.    Next Steps:    Ask one higher order question during each read aloud session.      Engage in whole class discussion seated in a circle following each read aloud.  Encourage the use of discussion prompts during this time.    On some occasions use the read aloud time as an opportunity to teach and engage students in debate work.    On some days students can and should listen for evidence to support a particular question and position and take notes when the book is being read aloud.  This reinforces listening and note-taking skills.

As you are facilitating the conversation he could take notes tracking number of students sharing expected behaviors (e.g. actively listening and not raising hands while classmates are talking) or even how many students are building off of others' ideas.  This will give you some information on how your students are engaging in accountable talk.
0891324,2016,949103,2016-02-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Overall this lesson was reflective of how you are building in the academic skills and habits of mind needed to become independent learners (e.g. checklists for process of revisions word lists word walls partnerships paper choice etc.).    Next steps: Provide anchor charts that reflect the different types of poems explored in this unit.  A few students were confused between rhyming poems and repetition poems.  While you worked to address these misconceptions by highlighting that the same word used multiple times doesn't rhyme but rather it is the techniqe of repeating you had to have that conversation multiple times.  Differentiating between the rhyming and repetition is a common misconception and providing anchor charts exemplars and/or incorporating rhyming and repetition as part of your morning meeting routines can help strengthen this understanding while also minimizing the amount of direct-teacher support so that students can continue to develop independence (which is a skill that is evident you are working on).    I look forward to hearing your ideas for extending this learning and practice with literary devices such as repetition and rhyming beyond the poetry unit.  Let's discuss your ideas and possible learning opportunities during one of your preps this week or next.  Please let me know which date works better for you during the week of 3/27 and 4/4.
0891324,2016,1029257,2016-05-17 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Through your management techniques you maintained class calm amidst one student's disruptive noises.    You demonstrated care and respect for students.    The majority of students were able to explain what they were doing.    Students were using a student-facing checklist with familiar craft techniques to self- and peer assess.  Students were giving each other feedback.    Next Steps:    Be cognizant of how you utilize the chime in order to yield the most effectiveness.    Vary the tools that students are given in order to work towards more meaningful engagement for all.    Continuously discuss with all students the genre they are writing.  Consider having a space in the room dedicated to the genre while the unit is taking place.  For example for this unit you could have a board filled with all sorts of letters - letters from long ago postcards friendly letters business letters persuasive letters letters to the editor typed and handwritten letters etc.

0893686,2014,123523,2013-11-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see feedback in-brief that I provided you with at our post-observation conference:    Highlights    •	You consistently asked students to explain their ideas using follow-up prompts such as: “How do you know it’s a museum” “What in the picture tells you it’s big” “How do we know it’s huge” “How do you know it’s big from the photograph” and “What part of it tells you that?”  These prompts pushed students to justify their responses and thus think more deeply.    •	You used the Promethean board on multiple occasions to show students photographs of and plans for the Guggenheim Museum and Frank Lloyd Wright’s home Falling Water.   You prepared for students to view multiple images on various Internet sites clearly having researched and selected the most ideal images and sites ahead of time.  When Wilson brought up the picture of the boy roller skating down the Guggenheim ramp you validated his knowledge and then later when students were working independently found the image and showed the class.  By using technology in these ways you were able to both tap into and build students’ background knowledge.     To Work On as You Move Forward    •	Work on being more conscious of the amount of independence that you give students to struggle and problem-solve when they are having difficulty.  During our pre-observation conference I asked how you would work with students who had difficulty you stated that you would “have other students help them or help them yourself.” During the lesson both David and Wilson had difficulty constructing the boxes.  When Wilson had difficulty you folded one side for him and said “So these are your tabs.  So show me what you’re going to do next.”  Wilson began to fold.  You immediately took it away from him again and folded virtually the entire box.  Four minutes later you came back to Wilson took the box from him as soon as you arrived and then asked “How’s it going?”  While students may need some scaffolded assistance there is a benefit to struggling and working to problem solve on one’s own as well.  In this way students develop persistence and important problem-solving strategies.  Consider when you can model (as you began to do with Wilson) and then provide sufficient time for students to work on their own.  Work on being conscious of the amount of wait time you provide before taking over and doing the work yourself.    •	You have a thoughtful essential question for the 5th grade unit on architecture posted in the classroom.  It is: “What does an architect contribute to our community?”  While you discussed ideas that relate to this question such as public and private places no mention of the essential question was made.  Consider integrating this thought-provoking question into the unit of study at various points and asking students to consider the question in relation to the work and discussion.  For example at the start of the unit you can introduce the question as the focus and purpose of the unit.  Then at the end of the introductory lesson that I observed you might ask the students to reflect through dialogue or writing on what their initial thoughts are about how architects might contribute to a community.  Then as the class explores architecture more throughout the unit you can ask students to build on this thought adding in new information to build bigger and more nuanced ideas.  These opportunities provide students a chance to think critically integrate knowledge and build sophisticated theories.  They also provide you a chance to assess student knowledge integration and content understanding.
0893686,2014,147917,2014-01-21 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,I know you expressed you want to revise your essential question for second grade which currently reads: "What traits make a character interesting" so that it connects directly to the puppet work you are doing in your classroom.  The second grade just finished a unit on characters. It would be great for you to bridge your work with what the students have learned and discussed in their class around characters and character development.  Their essential questions were:  "How does knowing my character's traits help me understand how my character changes and grows."  What lessons does the author want my character to learn?  One idea I am having for a secondary question to your current essential question is "How does knowing my character's traits help me make my character/puppet come to life?" I also recommend meeting with the second grade team to discuss some big ideas they uncovered and discussed during their unit which may help you with your unit.  In this way we can continue to reinforce big ideas students are unpacking and help them see how they connect across classrooms and beyond the lessons they are learning in their classroom.  It would also be interesting to see if we can tie your unit with the second grade unit for next year so that students may possibly construct puppets of characters they wrote short stories about.  This will assuredly help them focus on the wow factor.       I am curious on how you are planning to culminate and celebrate your puppets unit.  Are you planning on having your students engage in a puppet show?  Will they be writing short stories to go along with their puppets?  Please share with me your culminating activity/event.
0893686,2014,216340,2014-03-27 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,I truly enjoyed being a part of your classroom and observing your lesson.  It truly feels as though your students are part of the art community rather than just recipients of an art lesson. keep up the great work!  :-)

0893686,2015,505608,2014-10-15 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Summary of Highlights and Next Steps:    Highlights:  You used technology to show students the map and photographs of actual spectators and signs.  This was a great way to connect students to the event and build their background knowledge.    The work of creating NYC marathon signs is authentic and purposeful.  Experiential authentic work is exactly the type of work that has the potential to develop students' understanding of larger concepts.    Student behavior was appropriate throughout the observed lesson.    The tone of the room was calm and respectful throughout.  One student Sierra even took accountability for a peer by urging her to sit down after the mini-lesson.    Next Steps:  Work to change the structure of exchange in at least one place during the mini-lesson.  Ask a question of which the discussion will lead to student understanding of a bigger idea or concept.
0893686,2015,598833,2014-12-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You made efforts to collaborate with Mr. Fernandez and integrated a tool to which students had already exposed in 5th grade Literature & Art.  Students were familiar with this tool and one even reported having a plan for how he was going to use it.    Students were given a significant amount of independent work time.    Students were engaged in the work.  They had opportunities to make choices about various elements of their own books.  Some students were appropriately paired together to develop a book.    Next Steps:    1) When planning lessons ensure that you plan explicit mini-lessons that will scaffold student understanding and deepen the level of thinking and planning that students can do and are called upon to do later in the lesson or unit.    2) It is necessary for you to explicitly articulate the unit's big ideas and/or the content knowledge that you want students to understand (3a) during individual lessons.  I heard from three out of the four students that I asked about what they had learned how bookmaking is not a simple one-step process but that it involves multiple steps and takes a long time and a serious attitude.  No student told me what they knew about the different choices that authors and illustrators make in terms of binding or method of illustrating.  Below are the students' responses:    Me to Cialee: What have you learned about the art of bookmaking?  Cialee: That it takes a long time and since we're here only once a week it takes a long time.    Me to Nashali: What are you learning about bookmaking?  Nashali: That you you have to um get um you have to be serious because if you're not serious enough you'll mess up a lot.  And if you are serious you'll accomplish a lot of things."  Me to Nashali: Anything else you learned about how to make a book in art?  Nashali: That it's not so easy.    Me to Ahidsa: What have you learned about making a book?  Ahdisa: Um I learned how to make our little book. (At this point Ahidsa got out her small book and showed me how she learned how to fold it.)    Me to Mohamed: So tell me what you've learned about bookmaking in art class?  Mohamed: Well at first I thought it was just one step but now I know that it's like ten steps.  You have to go back and keep revising it.    Next time I myself would ask the students more explicitly about the different kinds of book constructions and illustrations and why they have chosen one or the other in order to truly know whether or not they understood these things.  This too should be how you focus your individual conferences.      3) You need to have some way of knowing what students understood after your lessons on the various kinds of book construction.  So you can rotate from student to student and: 1) ask what type of construction they're planning to use (accordian or hand bound) as you were doing and 2) ask why they were making this choice (this question would give you some good information about how much they understood about why authors choose different styles of construction).    4) Some type of chart or self check-off list is necessary to guide students to do this multi-step project in a logical order.  When I spoke with Ahidsa she was unclear about her plan.    Me to Ahidsa: Tell me about what you're doing.  Ahidsa: I'm trying not to copy the characters from the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.  I'm just trying to draw their face and mixing up characters.  Me: What do you mean?  Ahidsa: Like Princess Peach put it here.  Or Mario put it here.  Me: What's your story about?  Ahidsa: I don't know.  I'm trying to think about it.    We held a pre-observation conference on December 5 2014.  We met for a post-observation conference on January 29 2015.  At our conference we discussed all rated components as well as the work that you did with your students during the rest of the unit's lessons that followed my formal observation.  We spent a significant amount of time discussing ways to really know what students understand and are taking away from your lessons.  We also spent a lot of time discussing the need to hone your plans so that you always have a very clear teaching point identified even if the teaching point relates to the work of making decisions about next steps or materials to be used.
0893686,2015,633120,2015-03-02 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Highlights:  You used technology to help students build background knowledge about the function of the habitats of a garden.  This was an excellent motivator and way to meet the needs of diverse learners.      Your plan and intent to have the third graders think of their audience (Kindergartners) and develop their collages to communicate with this young group of students reflects your thoughtfulness and deliberate planning for learning tasks to be authentic experiences.    Recommendation:   Please review the visual arts blueprint for a clearer guide on how to develop your plans to support the scope of the visual arts curriculum.  I highly recommend looking at the sample unit plan on page 53 and the assessments section starting on page 50 and ending on 52.
0893686,2015,750179,2015-05-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You clearly demonstrated how to create a pinch pot.  You thought ahead about and discussed some of the problems that could arise while making pinch pots.    You planned ahead to provide an opportunity for students to plan and reflect on their experiences with two different kinds of clay.  In this way you were working to be able to advise each student about her/his next steps and gather information about each student's understanding of the two different types of clay.    Next Steps:    Your written lesson plan indicates what the teacher and students will do in every category.  From this some sense of the lesson's sequence is derived.  However there is little specificity to the plan.  For example the plan states that students will review vocabulary though no vocabulary is listed. I feel strongly that your execution of lessons will skyrocket if you spend time thinking carefully about exactly what you will say and do paying attention to how you will demonstrate what questions you will ask and when and how you will monitor student understanding.  I am more than happy to review and give you feedback on some lesson plans either at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.  Do not hesitate to email some to me.    Please review and implement Responsive Classroom teacher language techniques.
0893686,2016,858377,2015-11-13 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students had a significant amount of independent work time.  This was also a highlight that I noted in your December 2014 formal observation.    You acknowledged Adrianna's ability to pull herself out of the emotional rut she was in at the start of the work period.  In this way you demonstrated genuine care for her both as an individual and an artist.    Student behavior was appropriate throughout the observed period.    Students were fully engaged throughout the observed period.  One of two probed students was able to explain what he was doing with specificity.  Two other students provided directions to me.  Finally one of two students was able to use taught content vocabulary.      Next Steps:    Conclude your lesson deliberately focusing on one strategy technique social/emotional aspect etc. that you feel can have widespread impact with the particular class you are teaching.    Use a chime or bell and a raised hand to quiet students in order to eliminate your own need to yell and/or speak over students.    Focus on developing all students' content vocabulary.  Options for reinforcement include: displaying the current unit's vocabulary prominently and referring to it regularly yourself placing mini-charts or table tents with current unit vocabulary on each table utilizing content vocabulary during your own mini-lessons encouraging children to talk about their work using content terminology (e.g. Tell me (or a partner or a lower grade student) about your process.  Be sure to use specific terms as you discuss your work.).  Regular reinforcement of content vocabulary is necessary in order for the terms to be owned and utilized naturally by students.    As part of P.S. 154's Studio in a School three year grant you are currently working closely with the resident teaching artist.  As part of this work you partake in unit planning sessions meet with the teaching artist once a week to discuss the progress of the teaching artist's unit and share or brainstorm ideas and observe the teaching artist teaching the 4th grade classes. The teaching artist will model for you how to work collaboratively with children to curate their own work.  It is expected that you integrate this work into your own practice ultimately displaying all student work for one class from one unit by the end of January.  By April it is expected that you are doing this work with all classes in at least one grade.
0893686,2016,939403,2016-03-02 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Highlights:   -- As mentioned in previous feedback it was great to see you using technology and multimedia to frontload information for students to get them engaged in the content of Chinese writing (calligraphy). Students seemed to enjoy the film as was evidenced by comments made by Maddux ("It was cool") and Alimata ("It was also cool because there were little kids and they were learning it"). You did a nice job in laying out your expectations with the practice pages and detailing what information you would use to determine whether they were ready for the next stage in calligraphy writing ("At the end of class you shouldn't have lots of ink on you - that'll tell me whether you're read for the suni ink.")  You were also clear and explicit in your direction with how to use the practice pages; which helped clarify the misconception for some students like Nafi. ("The box should be your square.  The star inside should be your center. Nafi I noticed that you were tryng out lots of characters which is great you challenged yourself.  Just remember to use each full box as your square and the star as your center because on your practice page you had four characters in each square.")    Recommendations and Next Steps:   --Based on the evidence and overall feedback in your observation your lesson planning should be your area of focus at this time.  After analyzing all of the evidence the most logical next step for you is to focus on developing a true teaching point.  Your lesson plan target states "Learn about the history and imporance of Chinese characters/calligraphy and practice different styles and techniques used in Chinese Calligraphy." However "learning about the history..." is not a teaching point it is an outcome.  What is missing is the "how"; how will they learn this information. In addition the second part of this target states "practice different styles and tecnhniques..."  Once again practice isn't a teaching point. How will they practice or rather what strategies will they use to develop this skill?  Choose one lesson for next week that you will submit to me for feedback on the following: identify the target (which is your outcome) and then think about what strategy or skill or information you will need to teach them to reach that target (this is your actual teaching point). Identify how you will teach them this what strategies or skills will you model/teach how will your students engage in the practice of this strategy/skill? Please submit this lesson to me at least one-two days before you teach the lesson so that I may provide you with feedback prior to the lesson. I will not be reviewing how you're checking for understanding at this time. I will only focus on the what and the how of your teaching point for now.    --As also mentioned in the feedback I sent you earlier as you move forward think about how you can facilitate discussion in your classroom and help students hold onto and make sense of what they are reviewing/observing.  For example at the end of the video you asked students if they had any comments about what they learned in the video.  Given that it was approximately a 10 minute clip consider providing supports for students to hold on to information.  One suggestion is having them stop and jot important or interesting information as they view the clip.  Provide graphic organizers for them to use to organize their old ideas with new ideas.  In this way more students will have opportunities to hold on to multiple sources of information time to process their thoughts and access the content and context you are providing which can result in a richer discussion about the topic; in this case the art of caligraphy.  This is also a way you can ensure and assess whether students are actually engaging with the video in a cognitively demanding way or if they are being passive in their learning by simply sitting still and staring at the screen.      --I'm also recommending you collaborate with your colleagues to facilitate the transference of previous learning opportunities witn new learning experiences you're providing. For example Ms. Hallan taught a unit on China to these students two years ago. I know she actively integrates you into her unit by having students interview you as an expert on the topic of China. Here is an excellent opportunity for you to link her work with yours. Invite her to come talk to the class providing a refresher of content they unpacked during their unit. Or ask her for some of the resources she used during her China unit so you could showcase in your room as a way to frontload & provide context; particularly since your target is to "learn about the history & importance of Chinese chracters/calligraphy & practice different styles & techniques used in Chinese calligraphy." An excellent opporutnity for you to do some of this integration right now to support transferance of skills & knowledge is with Mrs. Gabbard's upcoming math unit on volume. In the Visual Arts Blueprint the fifth grade benchmark within the "art making" strand indicates students should "create a series of drawings that demonstrate: volume proportion gesture and control." This is a very seemless integration & Mrs. Gabbard has recently also expressed a desire to have the arts support this particular unit. It is also aligned with the work of Studio in a School. Please schedule to meet with Mrs. Gabbard to discuss how the two contents can be integrated to provide a rich learning experience in both disciplines. If you need me to coordinate the meeting let me know by next Tuesday. If I don't hear from you I am assuming you'll schedule your meeting with her directly.  Either way I'd like to meet with you briefly to discuss your collective plans for integration within two weeks (first week in April).  If you'd like me to be a part of the meeting with Ms. Gabbard please know that I am always willing to do this as I welcome the collaboration & being a think partner.
0893686,2016,1028393,2016-05-03 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,We met for a pre-observation conference on May 2 2016.  During our conference we discussed the necessity to align all aspects of all daily lessons plans to the specific day's teaching point(s) or objectives.  We also discussed the differentiation of unit goals across classes (based on how many times per week each class is seen) and within classes (based on students' skills.    We met for a post-observation conference on May 11 2016.    Highlights:    Your written lesson plan and enacted lesson demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of sculpture and artist Alexander Calder.    You demonstrated knowledge and understanding of VTS questioning and discussion techniques.  You repeatedly asked open-ended questions restated students' ideas and pushed students to explain their ideas.    You redirected students respectfully rather than chastising them.    You showed students examples of other students' notes pages narrating key note-taking strategies along the way.    Student participation in the slideshow discussion was high.     Next Steps:    Develop content concept and/or skill objectives for all unit plans.     Plan and enact lessons for which there is a clear teaching point and all aspects of the lesson deliberately align to this stated teaching point.  Work with Ms. Rosado Mrs. Quintero or Ms. Reynolds to better understand how to do this.
0893686,2016,1038698,2016-05-16 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Next Steps:    -I am recommending you revisit your system for managing materials and transitioning students within the lesson. You had each student go up one-by-one and make a selection of the color play-doh they would like to use. While it was good practice for students to practice reciting colors it did take a long time to get all students to their tables with their materials (this process took about 5 minutes). It might be better to have groups of students (by table) come and make their selections. You can still have them practice naming colors by having them label their selections on a sheet set at their workstations. Of course this is one idea and you may have others but the big idea here is building a more efficient transition from the carpet to the table.      -In addition if you have graphic organizers or sheets at each work station beforehand for students to label their selections they can then reflect at the end of the period on their choices and their discoveries during exploration.  This will also help align your activities with your instructional purpose which will be reflective of stronger designs of coherent instruction.  You can also use these sheets as an assessment tool to determine which students will need more time exploring or which students will need more language development; information you can then share with their classroom teachers and/or service providers.    I look forward to seeing/hearing of some of your ideas around tightening the transitions within your lesson as well as tools you plan to use that will challenge your students to justify their thinking planning and big ideas around the art and materials they use and create. Your summative conference will be an excellent time to share some of these resources or ideas.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You have daily structures in place that keep the class moving at all times (e.g. sitting at the carpet on the perimeter using slates exit question).    You consistently track student understanding and progress (daily exit questions and binders full of notes from yourself and both City Year corps members).    There is an expectation of explanation in your classroom as well as an expectation that knowledge is always shared.  Through your well-executed questions you push students to explain their thinking.    Next Steps:    Be aware of how the intonation of your voice may at times give away answers.    Although students may have logical consequences not doing the work cannot be an option.
0893713,2015,618029,2015-01-13 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your lesson plan is specific and clear.  You differentiated your plans for small group instruction with detail so that both yourself and the City Year corps members can effectively work with the students in their groups.    For the most part students easily took risks in your whole class discussions.    The structures and routines that you have in place and consistently follow caused no instructional time to be lost and students to be well-behaved on-task and positive throughout the course of the observed lesson.    Next Steps:    Try to work in opportunity for some student self-reflection with each exit slip.    Watch the tone of your voice when you ask questions that have only two possible answers.  These types of questions tend not to elicit much student thinking at all because of the tone of voice and ordering of the options (the right answer is typically stated second after the "or").    We held a post-observation conference on Tuesday February 24th.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:      Your pedagogical moves evidence your extensive knowledge of the mathematical content you are teaching.    Your learning plan follows a logical sequence and consistently returns to the day's essential question.    Your interactions with students demonstrate both your high expectations for student civility and participation and your own genuine care for students.    You ask high level questions and consistently push students to justify their thinking.  Students easily explained their own thinking.    Next Steps:    Consider how some teacher responses to disrespectful behavior can validate the students' behavior even if not intended to.    Although you only asked one be mindful of posing either/or questions.
0893713,2016,904797,2016-01-14 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    It is evident from both your lesson plan and the observed lesson that you worked hard to develop students' understanding of a big idea/concept.    You utilize high leverage content-area vocabulary regularly in your own talk and encourage students to use these words in their own talk.    You place the onus for thinking and reasoning on students demanding constantly that they support their ideas and/or explain their reasoning.  Your expectation for students' cognitive engagement is high.    Next Steps:    When thinking about and planning for students like Jeremiah who have shown little progress identify one to two realistic goals to work towards with these students.  This may include standards mastery of 4th grade content standards.  No matter what the goals are work to consistently plan for instruction that targets these goals even if with a student tutor or during a conference with you twice a week.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,During my visit with the Superintendent we were highly impressed with:    -your questioning techniques  -the extremely high level of student engagement  -the high level of thinking that students were doing  -students' abilities to explain their work and self-assessments in their portfolios  -the clarity of your learning environment (e.g. vocabulary at the front of the room large word wall)
0893713,2016,982280,2016-02-26 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,We met for a pre-observation conference on February 22 2016.  We met for a post-observation conference on March 8 2016.    Highlights:    You differentiated your plans and practice to address the current levels of understanding of varied groups of students.    You demonstrated genuine respect for the students as learners.    You were well-prepared for transitions and used language and directions strategically to prevent off-task behavior.    Throughout the lesson you used questions and follow-up prompts that served to advance student thinking and challenge them cognitively.    You used real-life situations to which students could relate to engage them from the start of the lesson.    You pushed students beyond the day's work when appropriate.    You gave students consistent verbal and written feedback throughout the observed period.  You provided all students with a related exit question at the end of the period.      Next Steps:    Consider using tactile manipulative-based hands-on work with students like Jeremiah who may have a math dyslexia.  Research shows this to be effective.  The content you cover with him however will likely need to be content/standards from a lower grade.
0893713,2017,1100909,2016-10-17 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your lesson plan is entirely aligned to the stated objective.    You differentiated student goals and student work.    You provided specific individual written and verbal feedback to all students.  To those whom you were unable to get to during the class period you promised that you would check their work before the end of the day.    All but one student was engaged in productively completing the independent work.  You reacted to this singular student by adjusting his work plan so that the task appeared more manageable for him.    Immediate Next Step:    Develop a system that allows students to keep working once they have completed the assigned work and are ready for it to be checked.  As mentioned above a color-coded laminated card system would be ideal in that it does not disturb the tranquility of the room but frees students up to do something else as they wait for you to be able to come to them.  I have seen signal cards on a small ring and placed at each seat (you could have them in a small basket in the middle of each table).  Some options for signal cards include but are certainly not limited to: "My work is complete and ready for teacher feedback" "I know how to get started but I have a clarifying question" and "I feel really confident and don't want to be interrupted at this time."  Please develop some type of system before we leave for December break.  This will mean that you will need to have a) a plan for what students will do when they are done and want to get their work checked and b) a plan for what type of work students will move on to when they are waiting for teacher feedback (e.g. independent fact fluency practice challenge problem etc.) or have received teacher feedback but are waiting for others to finish.

0909575,2014,114995,2013-12-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),COVIELLO ALISON,Please see my email feedback sent on December 16 2013 and pasted below:    It was evident that you prepared for the guided reading group with River Sean and Joseph ahead of time.  You had two cards with the sight words on and in written on them.  Although I did not see the start of the guided reading lesson you utilized these cards at the end asking River to check which word he was reading.  He quickly looked at the cards and corrected his mistake.     During guided reading you consistently focused students' attention on the book's pattern and the fact that the pattern changed at the end.  You stated "So the second time that we read we did a much better job following the pattern and remembering the pattern."     Across the classroom students were consistently engaging in partner reading.  They were familiar with the books they were reading even if the books were not at their independent reading levels indicating that the books had been read together in class. Hatou and her partner pulled out Down By the Bay and began to sing the book while also tracking the words with their fingers.  At one point the girls lost track of the words (their singing got ahead of their fingers).  I brought them back a page and reminded them to track the words with their fingers and they were able to do so perfectly indicating their familiarity with one-to-one correspondance and beginning letter sound recognition.     You used Veronica effectively to manage students during both independent and partner reading.  In addition you called on her to tell you (and thereby the class) what she noticed about partners' reading work.  She was attentive to particular reading behaviors noting that students were "pointing and looking at their books."     During your writing mini-lesson you explicitly modeled your own thinking and writing.  You began by saying "Today I'm ready to write my words.  So just like we did this morning during Morning Message first I'm going to think about what I want to say and then I'm going to point to where I want to write it.  So first I'm going to think about what I want to say."  You then demonstrated looking at your picture saying your own sentence counting on your fingers how many words the sentence was and then pointing on the page where you wanted to write the words.  Next you very clearly demonstrated your thinking as you wrote each word.  For example you said "What's the first word?  We.  I can find that on the word wall.  And I always start my sentence with a capital letter.  What's my next word?  Went.  It's not on the word wall so I'm going to stretch it out.  I don't hear any more sounds.  Let me go back and reread..."     You accurately demonstrated words that could be tapped out and words that needed to be stretched out.  This is a common mistake that teachers make but it is evident that you are very clear on the difference between the two types of words.
0909575,2014,291177,2014-02-25 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the informal feedback that I sent you via email on March 3 2014:    Highlights    You were previewing a big book with the class.  You used VTS questioning and discussion strategies throughout asking questions like "Emma what do you think is happening here?"; "So you think these monsters are running away from the pet.  What do you see that makes you say they're running away?"; and "Let's just look at the top picture first.  What's happening here?"  Because of your open-ended and continuous questions that asked students to respond with evidence students consistently answered with detailed responses such as: "The orange guy has a cooker hat and he's giving the pet some food" (Simone); "The boy is giving the crocodile some shampoo" (Skylamarie); and "I think they are under water and that's why the crocodile is making these bubbles" (Joseph).       You also worked hard to restate student responses in ways that highlighted how evidence from the text can be used to support an idea.  For example you said "Emma said she agrees with Jean that they're sleeping because their eyes are all closed."  Students in turn often used linking language like "because."  For example Jonathan said "I think he ate a light because he's lighted up."  Similarly Skylamarie said "That's his shadow because all that stuff is on the wall."     You rephrased students' ideas so that they included key vocabulary and clarified but did not change the idea.  For example when Simone said "The orange guy has a cooker hat and he's giving the pet some food" you responded with "Oh so the orange monster here is wearing a chef's hat like Cass wears."  Similarly when Alejandro said "He's throwing bubbles" you said "He's making bubbles with his mouth."     Throughout the observed period you spoke softly and slowly.  You gave lots of wait time in order to provide students with sufficient opportunities to think and formulate ideas.     To Work on as You Move Forward    You previewed the entire book as a whole class.  Work to wean students from the teacher-whole class model of discussion a bit.  For example you could have students talk in pairs or small groups about one or two pages each time you engage in a shared reading experience like this.  In this way students are beginning to develop some autonomy as they engage in high level talk and thinking.  They can even be taught to ask each other questions like "What do you see that makes you say that?"

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You skillfully used the components of the Morning Meeting to review and practice key reading and writing skills and expose students to the new genre of writing that the class is now working on in Writer's Workshop.    Your rapport with students was consistently calm patient and encouraging.    You were aware of Mia's tendency to get off-task and actively took steps to refocus her in subtle but clear ways.    Student engagement was consistently high.  You provided many and varied opportunities for students to think practice and participate.  The routines of work and practice are seamless.  Students are clearly aware of the routines thus enabling the work to occur quickly and productively.    You supported students in multiple ways throughout the observed period thereby providing varied opportunities for students to think practice and participate.      Next Step:    Consider ways to keep students like Ivan Emely and Mahamadou more focused and engaged during whole class lessons and activities.
0909575,2015,621363,2015-02-23 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You taught a clear and explicit mini-lesson that included a modeling portion and an extensive active engagement.    You asked many open-ended questions and repeatedly pushed students to justify their thinking.    Next Steps:    At this point in the year start to explicitly teach and work on students using the two agreed-upon Kindergarten talk prompts: "I noticed that..." and "I think that because..."    During the second half of the year start to teach students how to have productive partnership conversations where they use these prompts regularly.  In late spring you can also begin to introduce the 1st grade prompts which are "I agree with...because..." and "I disagree with...because..."  Teaching the students how to engage in meaningful talk and really listen to each other now is an extremely important skill.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You are a key school leader who has become actively involved in the work of moving the whole school forward.  You take initiative to share ideas and create collective understandings of where we are and where we want to go.  You are willing to open your classroom to others in order to inform and improve their practice and eager to receive feedback from others in order to inform and improve your practice.    You explicitly stated what you were going to be doing just before the modeling portion of your mini-lesson in order to focus students on the mini-lesson's teaching point and purpose.  Additionally after thinking aloud clearly you pointed out the strategy you modeled.    You utilized all adults including a substitute paraprofessional purposefully.  In this way students' individual needs were met and student engagement was high.    Next Steps:    As you move forward with the work of partnership discussions listen in to note the level of discussion that pairs are having.  The pair I listened to was "sharing out."  Work to move them towards carefully listening to each other and either agreeing disagreeing adding on or asking one another a probing question.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Both your preparations and actions during the lesson indicate your deep understanding of early literacy learning.    Your lesson was clear organized and well-paced.    You know students as individuals and took time to seamlessly address their needs respectfully and independently even during a whole class lesson (Aminata and Jordan).    There are strong systems and structures in place in your classroom.    You asked purposeful questions as a means to engage students in the work of using the strategy at hand.    Next Step:    At the end of a lesson work to involve all students in the work of naming strategies rather than just a few.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You explicitly modeled by thinking aloud and demonstrating throughout the observed lesson.    You modeled positive interactions with others for students.      You transitioned students calmly and respectfully using a song.  The routines in your classroom are clearly known and internalized by all students and adults in your classroom.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Below are two additional examples I captured that reflect the language you're developing in your classroom and evidence of strategies previously taught in your classroom hat students are transferring over to their new work:  -Madison: Bears sleep in caves and cuddle their cubs  -Amir: (tapping his words across the page:) Did you know that all of the superkids like different stuff?

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You facilitated active discussion of the Book-of-the-Month text with both clarifying detail questions and more open-ended questions that required students to explain their thinking.    You encouraged multiple ideas: "Did anyone think anything different?"    You asked students to speak with each other in pairs which they all did easily.

0930374,2014,251255,2014-02-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the “feedback in-brief” with which I provided you at our post-observation conference held on March 4 2014:    Highlights    You were consistently clear as you thought aloud and modeled how you worked as a writer planning out his ideas.  Your thinking was highly intellectual and you made it completely transparent thereby helping students to understand what you were doing and why.  For example you said “It seems that both of these stories give the impression that home is a safe place to be…School is the setting where the conflicts arise.  Alright so I’m gonna connect those two...I’m gonna connect those two because they show the role of parents in the girls’ lives…Right so I can write about how both of these authors are suggesting how school can be problematic and can create stressful situations for us.  I can write about how both of these authors write about home is a safe place a place where you can be yourself…Let me look at the things I didn’t connect….”    You consistently pushed students to prove their thinking with evidence from the text and to go deeper with their explanations in order to develop more rigorous theories.  For example at one point Danielle commented that Mrs. T. was a good influence.  You responded with “Can you say more about that?”  In response to your urgings Danielle provided some vague evidence “Because Mrs. T. is a good teacher and she’s trying to help out Chrysanthemum and Mrs. P. is…”  You then pushed Danielle even further saying “Can I push your thinking even more?  You’re saying that Mrs. T. is a good teacher and Mrs. Price is a bad teacher.  What makes a good teacher?  Can you define that for us?” Pushing Danielle and the others in the class in these ways serves to develop a culture of intellectual talk thought reading and writing.     Both of your charts are phenomenal and serve as model mentor texts.    You planned deliberately for the small groups that you would work with.  You utilized their work from the day prior to determine what they were struggling with.  You developed supports for each of these groups that served as helpful scaffolds.    To Work On as You Move Forward    Be sure that all students can see as you are modeling your own thinking and work.  As you modeled your own comparative thinking with the two bubble maps during the mini-lesson Maggie Danielle and Tashea were not looking at the chart you were using to demonstrate.  It seemed that they were seated in a position that did not allow them to see.    Your own bubble map served as a phenomenal mentor text for students.  It included many high level theories about each text such as: the “red sweater is [the] external conflict”; “Chrysanthemum needs to become confident”; and “Children can be misunderstood.”  Still there were some students including Jennifer Natalie and Tashea who did not have theories written down on their bubble maps.  Instead they had details or exact quotes from the texts written down.  Think about making smaller copies of your bubble maps to give to these strugglers.  Ms. Haynesworth takes pictures of some of her anchor charts and then prints them and puts them in sheet protectors.  You might also pair these strugglers with peers who have a good grasp of what a theory is and coach these peers to help the strugglers build a few theories.  You did pull some of the students who were struggling with this work into a small group and noted that it was impossible to meet with all of them in one day.  Consider other supports they can be given so that the time on this day when you cannot meet with them is as productive as possible.

0930374,2015,597133,2014-12-08 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students were reading historical fiction texts in book clubs that directly related to the content being studied in Research & Information.    Students were given academic choices for the ways that they organized their thinking.  This was a nice way to engage students and to work on students' knowledge of self.    Students were consistently expected to support their ideas with text evidence.    Your interactions with students demonstrated extreme respect for them as intellectuals and individuals.  This respect definitively contributes to the culture of teaching and learning that permeates your classes.    Next Steps:    Engage students in individual conferences away from other book club members so that they have as great an opportunity to think for themselves as possible.    Ensure that students consistently engage in much more independent reading per day.  A minimum of 30 minutes each day should be your goal.  This will mean shortening your mini-lesson somewhat tightening the routines for getting started consistently noticing yourself and publicly noting to the class those students who read well throughout the independent reading time and minimizing interruptions or disruptions during the independent reading period.    Make the expectations for independent work very clear ahead of time (don't assume they know the expectations) (3a - Communicating with students).  When I spoke to Ishmael after the independent reading period for example he explained that he only read for about 5 minutes because his group was done with their book club book so he was just thinking about ways that his character was brave.  When I asked what he and Mohamed would read over the next two days when the rest of the class would be finishing their books he shrugged and said he didn't know.  I also asked him what he would read for homework and he said he didn't know.  I told him he should ask you.  In response you announced that students who were done should read their independent reading books to which Ishmael replied "Oh okay."
0930374,2015,618155,2015-01-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your lesson plan is specific aligned and detailed.  You think carefully about the work that your students have already done in order to plan your next steps.  You consider possible hurdles for students and plan ways to effectively instruct students facing these particular challenges.     Students were all engaged with their books and able to speak about the texts they were reading.    When speaking students used academic language readily (e.g. "Meanwhile...").    Next Step:    Work to push students to think more independently (most double bubble maps looked similar to yours even though the students were working with different characters and texts).  Push students who are reading at Levels R and above to think more holistically about their texts.  Given their reading levels their theories can/should be more layered than the generally linear theories you modeled and they were coming up with.    We met for a pre-observation conference on January 9 2015.  During this meeting you provided insight into the work you had done with students during the first two bends of this unit.  You also discussed the work that Monica does with students and explained that each time you revise the structure of your conferences Monica observes you first.    We met for a post-observation conference on February 24 2015.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You provided a useful book introduction to the three students with whom you were working demonstrating your awareness of the background knowledge they would need to successfully interact with and comprehend the text.    You worked individually with each of the three students in the club targeting their unique fluency or comprehension needs.      Next Steps:    As you plan for guided reading instruction look ahead to proper nouns that come up quite a bit during the reading and that may prove difficult for students.  Write these on index cards ahead of time and briefly share them with students telling them what they are names of (e.g. person city etc.) and pronouncing them.  Familiarity with these words ahead of time may make student reading more fluent and thus improve students' overall comprehension of what they are reading.    Provide students like Jeremiah with self-monitoring supports.  For example you could place a post-it in his book every 2 - 3 pages and require him to stop and summarize when he comes to each post-it note.
0930374,2016,948974,2016-02-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,It is evident that you are pushing students to think deeper and match the quality of their writing to their level of thinking.  It was impressive to watch you challenge your students and pull a group that was comprised of students who are reading at different levels but are able to think critically at the same level.   It is a breath of fresh air to see that students are not pigeon-holed into reading levels in your class and everyone is challenged equally in intensity even if it means they are challenged unequally in terms of content. This is true differentiation.    Next Steps:  -As a model teacher I know you have opened your doors to your colleagues to observe various techniques within your practice.  I want you to consider framing an intervisitation  around differentiation based on multiple data sources in order to help others uncover the multiple groupings they could create in their classroom that go beyond reading level.  What I am speaking here is about authentic and data-driven strategy groups.  I think this is work that the ICT partnerships in fourth grade could benefit from.  I'd like to discuss this further with you to schedule visits for some of these partnerships to observe and discuss with you.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,When Superintendent Alvarez and I visited your classroom on this date we were impressed by:    -the high level of student engagement across the class  -the extremely rigorous work in which students were engaged  -the visibility of student agency in your classroom  -your utilization of the City Year corps member working in your classroom (she was conferencing individually with students around recent short responses that they wrote)

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,POOLMAN BETHANY,Your class was purposeful and focused on a deep dive into conflicts within texts.  Students clearly understood the class routines and were busy at work once returning to their tables.  Your instructional materials were incredibly thorough and demonstrated a lot of thinking prior to the lesson’s implementation.  Most students were engaged and grappling with a robust challenging concept - analyzing the type of conflict the characters encountered and what larger theme the author might be trying to share with us about our own lives.  This deep dive was fun to watch.    In the future is it possible to increase student voice/participation on the rug to break up more of the adult speak?  Perhaps this time can have a few more student-driven elements such as stop and jots turn and act stop and think thumbs up/down turn and question etc.
0933441,2014,32817,2013-10-17 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,Hello Mrs. Milliron     Below are some bulleted noticings I would like to highlight and focus your attention to in order to maximize your pedagogical practice.    -During my observation you worked in a small group with Kymirah Laisha and Lory-Ann.  You worked with this group for the 20 minutes I was in your room and didn't get to circulate around the room to get a sense as to how the remainder of the class was doing with the task and the content.  In addition while you worked with these three students there was no evidence of observational or conference notes taken.  In order to be strategic with your instruction and tailor the strategies skills and resources for your students based on their readiness levels you need to regularly track and monitor your students' learning and their progress.  Ensure you are regularly documenting your observations and conferences with students and small groups.  This data should be used to assess not only your students' level of mastery and to determine their next steps but will  also help you establish when to change your flexible groupings as well as to determine what strategies are most effective with your students.      -During your small group work as well as during the whole class discussion all of the questions were posed by you.  The conversations that did exist were simply responses to your questions.  In order to get your students thinking deeper about the math they need to have the space and opportunity to formulate their own questions and to question/critique their peers' thinking/responses.  Think about possible question prompts you can display to facilitate your students through accountable talk in math.  This type of talk will get your students thinking harder and deeper about the math and their processes; which in turn will also get them more actively engaged in the learning.      -In addition when you asked Jailyn to share the process she and Adam went through the conversation turned into a recitation of steps while you modeled the process and the thinking.  Students need to have multiple opportunities to use the math language and have the words become familiar and comfortable in their mouths.  Rather than modeling the steps consider how your share can be framed to be an extension of the learning instead of a review of the learning.  One way I am thinking is to have your students chart their work and share with other groups using the following questions as conversation guides  1.) how is your strategy/solution similar AND different from mine?  2.) how do we know this is the best way to solve this problem?    I would love to hear other possible ways you are thinking about to engage your students in rich math discussions.  If you would like to discuss some additional strategies or ideas please let me know as I encourage the dialogue.
0933441,2014,158275,2014-01-21 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,CRUZ JESSICA,It was great a being part of your lesson.  I just wanted to leave you with two bullets regarding our discussion during your post observation conference.    -We discussed the need to include tier three vocabulary like quotient dividend and divisor during the onset of the unit of study.  This way students can be able to use the words during their discussions thereby increasing automaticity with word usage.  -During our conversation you shared that you are reconsidering for next year spending a whole day's lesson on this strategy.  We brainstormed the possibility of establishing stations in which stations focus on various strategies.  In this way you could teach and work through the strategies in two - three days.  This will allow you more time to go deeper into tackling word problems and discussions about most appropriate strategies to be used with the word problems.     Lastly you shared a wonderful tool you have created with your students:  the strategies book where they listed and described all of the strategies taught.  I think it would be great to see what students determine to be better strategies for them.  You may want to consider having students make report cards for the strategies and identify which ones work best.  This will provide you with clear information on what your students understand how they process and what they rely on to do and think about math.  It also makes for a great bulletin board display!
0933441,2014,250320,2014-03-25 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the informal feedback that I emailed to you on March 30 2014:    You were effectively utilizing the ELMO to easily illustrate both the suggestions that students were making about splitting fractions and your own points about equivalent fractions.  At one point you even invited Jeremiah up to the ELMO to demonstrate his thinking.    You made attempts to involve and engage students throughout the lesson.  For example you called on Grissanet and Jeremiah students who do not typically volunteer their own thoughts several times.  You asked Justin to sit up more than once one time even physically moving him in order to get him to sit up.  You asked students to talk in groups about how much of the sub sandwich each person could get.  You used the ELMO.  These attempts had varied results however.  For example Jailyn Mya Roosevelt and Johnell formed a group during the turn and talk yet only Jailyn and Roosevelt spoke.  Enrique had his head down for a good portion of the mini-lesson.  While working with Jeremiah at the ELMO only three students were actually looking at the work that was being projected on the board.  It is necessary to more actively monitor student focus and engagement.  You might consider seating all students in front of you when you are seated at the ELMO so that you can see exactly who is focused and on task at all times.  In addition you might consider more frequently alternating whole class discussions with partner work on particular problems.    You consistently pushed students with open-ended questions that encouraged students to think independently and conceptually and to explain themselves.  For example at one point you asked "But why's she saying she's just going to split it into two pieces.  Two friends will get this half and two friends will get two pieces.  Why's she saying this?"    During the independent work time you sat in one chair next to Johnell and Justin and across from Roosevelt and Enrique during the time I observed.  You did not appear to have any particular agenda or pre-planned teaching point with any of these students.  Rather you looked over the work of the students near you and pushed them with questions like "So could you divide what you have here into six equal groups?"  As we have discussed extensively during our planning sessions make sure that you are deliberately planning for the work that is done by students and yourself (and other adults in the room) during the independent work time.  Which group and/or individuals will you work with?  What are your specific objectives for these students and why (e.g. what do you know about them that leads you develop these objectives)?  What will students who finish early do?  How will they be appropriately challenged?    Eventually Hanaan and Eduanny got up and stood next to you in an attempt to have you look at their work.  To Eduanny you said "Eduanny go to your seat.  I'll go to you in a second."  When you told Hanaan to have a seat she responded "I'm done."  You said "Alright well raise your hand.  Don't just get up."  It is imperative that you plan differentiated tasks for the independent work time so that students who finish early like Hanaan and Eduanny can either move on or work with each other to check and discuss their work.

0933441,2015,581440,2014-11-17 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    The students were actively using the resources that were provided around the room as they worked on solving problems.    The students were using content vocabulary in their talk with each other.    Next Steps:    Ensure that you have a deliberate plan for your own work during the independent work period.  With whom will you work and what is your plan for your time with each group and/or individual?  What do you hope to accomplish with them during the small group work or conference?  Please start a rotating schedule of small group work.    Support all paraprofessionals and City Year corps members so that they are better equipped to work with students without giving away answers.  You may need to provide these adults with guiding questions or prompts.  Another option would be to have them observe you working with a small group and then discuss what they saw you doing or what types of questions they heard you posing.    Please end each class period with an exit question so that you are acutely aware of what children have mastered individually and so that students begin to get in the habit of thinking independently each day.  Develop a routine for this structure.  For example when you state at the last five minutes of class that it is time to complete the exit question students should quickly take out folders that separate their work space from that of their peers next to them.  Students should know how to read and take apart the question they are given each day as well and students should know to work swiftly and smartly.  Stay positive during this time so that students are excited for the challenge each day.
0933441,2015,573159,2014-12-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    The classroom is starting to act as a resource for students with vocabulary and key strategies from the current unit strategically positioned at the front of the room for easy use.    Students were talking with each other across the classroom sharing their own strategies and explaining themselves to students in their groups.    Next Steps:    Provide standards-based next steps to students on all work.      Assign an adult to survey the room and note students who are struggling with basic concepts that can be easily addressed in a quickly-pulled small group or one-to-one conference during which an adult explicitly teaches the concept.
0933441,2015,735356,2015-05-05 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Engaging students with Paul Klee's art work is a thoughtful interdisciplinary connection.  There are many possibilities for making this a rich and rigorous experience.      You routinely use Ms. P. to provide multiplication fact fluency support.      Next Steps:    Ensure that every lesson plan has a clear standards-based objective.  Consider the grade level standards in math literacy and art when developing these objectives.      Work to develop genuine discussions amongst students that are framed largely by open-ended questions.
0933441,2015,763978,2015-05-26 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,

Student behavior was appropriate throughout the observed period.    Next Steps:    1) Explicitly model new strategies.      2) Use questions to either briefly check for student understanding or stimulate or facilitate true discussion where multiple ideas or answers could apply.    3) Plan and ask questions of which the majority are open-ended and require student thinking.  Work to avoid or limit yes/no questions either/or questions and questions requiring one word or phrase answers and only one correct answer as these do not deeply engage students in thinking.    4) Plan for differentiated instruction.      5) Ensure that the human resources in your classroom are productively utilized at all times.    Please submit two lesson plans for the week of January 19th to me by Friday January 15th.  I will review and provide you with feedback to both of these lesson plans.  In my feedback I will focus on questioning presentation of new material differentiation of instruction and the purposeful utilization of adults.    I will return to observe you informally (non-Advance) during the week of January 24th in order to offer you feedback on the elements listed above.
0933441,2016,955816,2016-02-29 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your lesson plan is clear and detailed and includes a plan for explicit modeling on your part.    Student behavior was good.  You have signals in place that work effectively.    During the cube activity there was clear evidence that students were aware of what they were doing.    Kevin was able to independently explain his answer using because.    You asked Juanita a great open-ended question that pushed her to do the thinking.          Next Steps:    Determine a time to observe Ms. Gabbard and/or Ms. Adams teaching math.  When you observe them (please set up the observation to take place on or before April 22 2016) take notes on the questions that they ask.  Afterwards meet with the teacher to discuss how she determines (either in advance or on the spot) what questions she will ask.    Be attentive to the clarity of your teaching point and its purpose and the language you use.  When you think about language consider both the words you speak and the words numbers pictures that you write on the ELMO or charts.
0933441,2016,1004261,2016-04-22 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    The lesson had a recognizable structure.    You provided students with clear expectations for behavior.    Student behavior was appropriate throughout the observed period.  Students responded to verbal and auditory cues for attention.      Next Steps:    Utilize proper academic vocabulary at all times rather than abbreviations.    Create shared texts (e.g. charts) with and for students.  Ensure that students have access to charts throughout and beyond the unit.    Ensure that you clearly state the teaching point and goal of the day.  Explicitly link the day's goal to prior lessons at the start of the lesson.  Ensure that students understand what they will be doing how they will do something and why they are doing it.    Decrease the amount of questions that require students to provide definitions.  One way to do this is to utilize shared charts as a way to quickly review already taught information.  Do not use rephrased questions as a way to let students know that they are incorrect.  Plan key questions ahead of time that will require critical thinking and explanation from students.      Utilize all resources and pedagogical knowledge to engage all students all of the time.
0933441,2016,1023284,2016-05-13 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Thank you for asking me to return to your class a second time to see the continuation of your investigation.  During this visit I was able to see some students better able to make the connections between the area of the boxes of truffles and the factorization of that area through the different assortments they made (e.g. 20 - 1x20 2x10 4x5).    As shared in my initial feedback it seems students' had a big misunderstanding of the task's purpose.  Much of their attention when working in small groups was around making new shapes or making new boxes with the strips provided.  This may be due to the types of questions that were being asked (see above) since they focused so heavily on the criteria of rectangles.   The questions asked were mostly recall and describing-type questions; which require very low-level thinking.  I am suggesting you focus your attention to the questions you ask during whole group discussions as well as how you are facilitating discussions to help students explore and build understanding.  While it is perfectly reasonable to start with low-level questions becasue these types of questions help students build or strengthen a foundation of understanding from which to build from the level of questioning should increase in complexity to allow students opportunity to think more critically and continue to build their understanding.  I am leaving a list of question stems using Bloom's Taxonomy.  I'd lokve to see how you utilize some of thes stems to formulate questions that start with basic recall to build foundation and progress in complexity with some higher-order thinking questions that lend themselves more to investigations.
0933441,2017,1095536,2016-10-31 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    During the guided reading lesson that I observed during Reader's Workshop you demonstrated solid knowledge of the important concepts in literacy development.     Your interactions with students were friendly and student behavior was entirely appropriate throughout the observed period.    Next Steps:    By 12/9 introduce routines for transitions that minimize the amount of time spent moving from tables to the carpet and from the carpet to tables.    Plan and enact shares at the conclusion of Reader's and Writer's workshops that teach another small teaching point. In this way this instructional time is maximized.  Utilize the TCRWP units of study to guide you as you plan your shares.    By 12/9 develop and enact a system for taking individual and small group conference notes.  All notes should be standardized organized and accessible at all times.  During the observed guided reading period you turned over a piece of paper that you had in front of you and began taking notes on the back of this paper which was blank.    By 12/9 ensure that you have put into place the routine of beginning each math lesson with either 10 - 15 minutes of strings or math games.  By 12/9 you should have enough games prepared for students to be working on "Just Right games."  In addition students should have been already introduced to the routine of playing Just Right games with partners.    Reduce the number of students who read on the back carpet.  During this observed period Yvelisse was not monitoring these students and you were unable to see the students on the back rug from the table at which you were conducting guided reading.  Therefore please limit the number of students on the back rug to four and ensure that Yvelisse is monitoring their reading engagement during independent reading time.    Do not use computer-based programs other than MyOn and iReady.  The reason for this is that there are so many computer programs that are available and while some are valuable many are not.  To avoid time being spent on lower quality programs please use only the programs that P.S. 154 has approved.  You mentioned in your email response to me that you were using the program as a "quick break."  Please utilize Responsive Classroom energizers (you received a book on Energizers from me in September 2015) or Move-to-Improve activities (Yvelisse is trained on Move-to-Improve) instead as breaks.

Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,Janine overall you have some structures and practices that are conducive to learning (e.g. meeting one on one with students to discuss their pieces and their next steps).  What I believe you need to think deeper about is how to develop learning tasks that are directly aligned to a learning outcome rather than just an activity.  Students should be able to identify (or be guided into understanding) the big ideas behind your lessons (e.g. "characters change because..." "the sequence of events in a story is important because...and changing it can impact a story in the following ways..." etc.).  Focusing on the big idea will help you identify specific teaching points that are targeted and strategically scaffolded.  It will also help you identify what tools resources scaffolds are needed for which students; which in turn will lead to more cognitively engaging and challenging learning outcomes.

0947312,2014,181852,2014-03-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the informal feedback that was sent to you via email:    You repeatedly asked students to find evidence in the text to support their answers and reminded them to refer back to the text before selecting an answer for the multiple choice questions that they were working on.  For example during the course of the mini-lesson you said "...so reread paragraph 3 and then pick the best answer choice"; "Where did you get that?  Where does it say that?  You got that from somewhere because I'm looking at it."    Students transitioned quickly from the mini-lesson on the rug to the independent and small group work.  No time was wasted in between and students diligently began their independent work right away.    You were well-prepared to teach a small group during the independent work period.  Your small group lesson plan prepared model and prepared independent work reflects the research you did ahead of time and evidences a clear purpose and goal for these three specific students.    Gabby worked with specific students on the strategy that was taught during the mini-lesson.  To consider: a) How do you communicate the goal(s) for the day for this group of students to Gabby?; b) Do you differentiate the work that these students do at all?; c) Does Gabby have the TCRWP "if then" page to utilize in case students aren't successful using the already-taught strategies?  Also what more can Gabby do during the mini-lesson?  Can she sit on the rug with a particular student to help scaffold their understanding or work next to students to keep a few students focused?  I'm sure she typically works directly with Shawn.  Be sure that she is utilized fully when he is gone as well.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your expectations for work time were apparent and consistently high.    Students compared their own writing to particular touchstone texts including Owl Moon and Come on Rain.  They were able to explain why their writing was similar to each of these two texts.    Students provided each other with meaningful standards-based or teaching-point based feedback.    Next Steps:    Work to provide students with strategies that they can use to actually invite feedback from their peers.  For example instead of closing their notebooks as soon as they are done sharing teach them to keep their notebooks open and ask "What questions or suggestions do you have for me?"  Similarly instead of you probing the larger group for feedback push the sharing writers to ask for feedback themselves.  This is similar to a Morning Meeting share when the sharer states "I'm ready to take questions now."
0947312,2015,635199,2015-03-02 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students have opportunities to determine their own learning preferences and needs in your classroom (e.g. choosing where to sit).    There are routines and practices in place that allow the classroom to run smoothly and efficiently.      You are an active and valuable thought partner to and with your colleagues.  You are equally accountable to yourself and your colleagues always ensuring that you follow-through with self- and collectively-assigned tasks.  Together with Ms. Hallan you habitually analyze student work and then plan appropriate future whole class or small group lessons.    Next Steps:    Be sure that you have specifically determined each lesson's intended outcome ahead of time and ensure that the modeling and independent work portions of the lesson align with this objective.

0947312,2015,749778,2015-05-06 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You have high expectations for the adults who work in your classroom.  As a result there is a sense of collective responsibility for student success amongst all adults in your classroom.    Students were aware of and responsible about setting reading goals before beginning the day's book club reading.      Next Steps:    When planning for read aloud ensure that you are intentional about planning one or two important broad open-ended questions for the group to discuss.  Prepare these questions ahead of time so that they are well-phrased higher-order and appropriately placed.  By planning ahead for read aloud you can also plan your structures of talk.  For example you might choose to have students talk in small groups and then decide upon one big idea the group realized or debated to share with the larger group or you might plan for students to talk in a large circle with one student jotting down the comments and ideas on a piece of chart paper as they are discussed.    When providing students with standards-based checklists ensure that they understand the language of the standards well enough to self-assess.  It will likely be necessary for you to rephrase the standards and/or review each one.  You may also want to limit the number of standards you give them during any given unit to think about themselves.  Perhaps it would be more meaningful to students to have just three - five standards to focus on altogether.  You could probably differentiate these focus standards based on what you know about students and their most recent student work.
0947312,2016,867408,2015-12-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You demonstrated a strong understanding of Visual Thinking Strategies techniques and used these techniques consistently to create a safe and productive discussion in which 89% of the students participated.    Your expectations for student work and participation are high.    Students in your classroom treat each other with respect and care.    You asked open-ended questions restated students' ideas pushed students to explain their thinking and deliberately provided sufficient wait time.    You provided a talk prompt guide for students to refer to during the discussion.      Next Steps:    Purposefully collect data during VTS discussions in order to push the level of student thinking and/or push the ways that students participate.  For example one student used "It could also be..." and one other student used "I noticed that..."  The rest of the participants who used a conversation prompt used either "I agree with..." or "I disagree with..."  You could have Stefania tally the conversation prompts that were used during the discussion about the first image.  She could then share these out in between images and you could use this data to encourage more students to utilize the talk prompt cue card in order to enter the conversation in different ways.  Another way that you could use Stefania to help assess student thinking is to have her track the number of observations and the number of inferences students make during the course of the conversation.  You could share these at the end of the discussion and perhaps even give examples of observations versus inferences at the start of the lesson so that you are explicit with students about what the assessment criteria are.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Awesome job in planning and executing a lesson that allows students time and space to self-assess and develop the skills needed to write their baby literary essay.  Based on the email you sent me after your informal observation it is clear you have made deliberate modifications to your unit framework and the progression of lessons which as detailed above in component 1e-obs. proved to be effective instructional decisions.  I would love for you to consider sharing your thought process and how you revised your unit framework based on evidence gathered from last year.  This would be ideal in the coming months when we start to get together as teams to revisit and revamp curriculum scope and sequence for next year.  Hearing from a fellow colleague and having a model of how this is done will be especially helpful to some of our newer staff members.  Please let me know your thoughts on this and we can sit and discuss a possible professional learning session in the coming months.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You took time to review the unit's essential questions with the class.  In this way you were explicit about what they would be investigating during the course of the unit.    There are clear systems and routines in place in your classroom.    Children are aware of the expectations for reading and reading logs.  You are consistent with your collection and analysis of reading logs.    You engaged students in a beginning-of-unit goal-setting process during which students had opportunities to connect their pre-assessment work to the work that they would do in the unit ahead.      Next Steps:    Consider how you will ensure that a) students fully understand the skill that they have chosen as their goal and b) how students will consistently work toward this goal and reassess their progress towards it.

You not only managed to target specific areas to push your students as they track their reading but you also integrated the teaching point of your current unit into your conferences ensuring students have continued opportunities to practice showing their thinking.      I think it would be great for you to share your approach to these reading log conferences with the second grade as they are working with students who are at the beginning stages of tracking their reading with longer books that require them to commit to for longer periods of time.  Please let me know if you are open to the idea of facilitating a demo or perhaps an intervisitation of your reading log conferences.
0947312,2017,1067387,2016-10-17 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,POOLMAN BETHANY,Your classroom was calm and focused on reading.  Students were engaged with their individual books logs or conferencing with you during this lesson.  Structures and expectations were clear supporting children to focus on their learning.  Conference time was used to address individual needs and set up reading goals.    To push your practice how can you improve upon your conference structure over time so that students are not simply responding to your prompts but actively engaging in the conversation?  There are many things you could consider.  Here are two possible suggestions:    1. Perhaps a student-friendly agenda or checklist can help the student lead the conference discussion.  This way they can lead the conversation around the basic stuff (i.e.-how many days they have read how many minutes titles etc.)  This way your specific contribution can be reserved for higher-level questions/prompts to activate student thinking.      2. Perhaps students can prepare something in advance of the conference that helps them self-assess / self-monitor their progress.  Then when you meet with them they have already considered their reading progress and can join be prepared to more actively and thoughtfully engage in a conversation about his/her current reading.

0955968,2014,253834,2014-02-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the “feedback in-brief” with which I provided you at our post-observation conference that was held on March 12 2014:  Highlights    The analogy you gave to the workouts that you do at the gym and the resistance that you have to push through as you work out there when you were describing the counter arguments that might be brought up in response to one’s thesis statement was engaging.  Students were all listening intently as you described your time at the gym.    You demonstrated someone actually presenting you with various counterarguments.  You did this by going back and forth between yourself and a different character.  This too was extremely engaging and was a helpful way for students to see what it means to be presented with a counter argument.  After you demonstrated this interaction you said “Okay so there you have it.  I thought about what somebody who is going to be against my argument would say.  And now I’m going to rebut it.  So remember what the word rebut means to respond to an argument to prove that it is false.”  Beginning with a demonstration and then defining the word was a nice way to build the students’ academic vocabulary.    You provided the students with an opportunity to try this work themselves when you asked them to consider possible rebuttals for the second counter argument that you thought of.  During the turn and talk several students had authentic in-depth conversations.  Ritza was able to tell a detailed story about dogs in her country and Jennifer and Jasmine were able to continue the rebuttal with other good points.  Note that there were at least three students who were simply sitting and engaged in no conversation at all.    Your teaching point during the small group work was clear and explicit.  You used student work to determine what you would teach this group of students.  You had prepared your own writing as an example for the group.  Ritza Gabriela Jariel and Natalie all went back to their seats and purposefully inserted evidence to support their ideas.    To Work On as You Move Forward     When you gave students directions for the independent work just as they were about to transition away from the carpet you said “Alright so you guys get the idea.  You’re gonna now take a look at your tree maps and you’re gonna look at the three reasons in your tree map.  Think of three counter arguments and think of three rebuttals.  Is that clear?  Turn this paper over.  So you’re going to be filling in your counter arguments in the first blank spaces.  Then you’re going to be rebutting in these three.”  Students only had a chance to practice coming up with a rebuttal although a large part of the work was thinking about counter arguments that others might present.  Ensure that students have opportunities to practice all parts of the work prior to doing it on their own.    The handout was meant to help students organize their thinking however complicated its many parts and steps made it complicated and thus somewhat confusing.  You read through the page and quickly showed the class how you used it to come up with a rebuttal statement.  After this you said to the class “Do you see that?  It makes sense to you?  Do you see how I used this chart to help me plan out the sentence my prompt my rebuttal?  So right now I want you to just take one minute and plan your sentence out.”  During this practice time five out of twelve students used the prompts correctly.  Six students didn’t have anything written down and one student (Jasmine) formed her sentence incorrectly.  Be sure to clearly model how to use any tools that you give out (like this chart).  Take time to get a better read on whether the tool is understood and actually acting as a help or a hindrance.  You asked students if they understood however to get a very clear sense of what they understand you must look at the work that they are (or are not) doing.    Ensure that the share portion of the lesson is deliberately planned with an eye toward furthering students’ understanding or deepening their skills.  You stated “A few of us were able to finish today’s chart and tomorrow we’re going to look at how we can embed your counter arguments.  Everyone did really really good work today.  So please take your drafts and put them in your folders.”  For future shares be sure to look carefully at students’ work during the independent work period (here you’re researching the room) notice a trend select a piece of work to both highlight one thing that was done well and use as a text from which to teach students a teaching point you’ve identified as key during the independent work period.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students were extremely knowledgeable about their topics and fully engaged in the work of writing books about their topics.  Students relayed a sense of purpose and understanding of self as topic experts.  For example when I asked Nashali what the point of all their work was and what she was going to do with her book when she was done she explained that she was "going to show all the people who walk through the halls how hard it was to deliver mail back then."    Students were provided a level of choice when selecting the topics for their books.    Students were provided with various types of resources from which to gather information about their topics including books and videos.      Next Steps:    Be sure that you are actively monitoring and evaluating student work at all times so that you can support students with appropriate teaching points during one-to-one conferences and small group instruction.  For example as I walked around the room I noticed that Cialee was copying text directly from the book to her own writing.  When I then asked Cialee what she was writing about she relayed factually correct information in entirely her own words.  Using this quick interaction with Cialee I knew that she understood the information but simply needed to be taught how to write without copying.  I then modeled for Cialee how to close her book and write in her own words.  For reasons like these active monitoring of student work is always necessary.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,I truly enjoyed how you integrate literacy with the social studies content without resorting to lecturing.  I would love for you to work with Ms. Reid so you can both share ideas on how to integrate the disciplines without sacrificing content or literacy instruction.  Please let me know if you would like me to facilitate the meeting and what your thoughts are about this possible collaboration.
0955968,2016,981347,2016-04-18 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You modeled the academic habits and skills of researchers (e.g. keeping a resource page and coding facts and quotes according to the resource from which they were taken).    You presented students with an authentic task embedded in a real-life context.      You expected students to act as "real researchers" considering multiple perspectives before drawing conclusions or forming opinions.    You asked students to reason about the stance that various titles of resources implied.  They were expected to explain their reasoning.      Next Steps:    Carefully plan for the successful flow of all lessons.  In addition to planning rigorous activities as you did consider the structures and tools that will support smooth reasonably-timed activities.
0955968,2017,1100913,2016-10-31 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    The written lesson plan and enacted lesson demonstrate your strong knowledge of the time period.    You utilized a video to engage students in the work of identifying main ideas.    All students were actively involved in note-taking while watching the video.      Next Steps:    Always provide a visual representation when working on developing main ideas from details or finding details to support main ideas.    Develop structures that will provide opportunities for and encourage all partners to participate in partnership discussions.    You consistently said to the students "Turn back to me" and "I heard things like..." At the start of the observation you said "What are the main ideas that you've gathered.  You're not telling me dates.  That's a detail.  You're not telling me places.  That's also a detail."  By using the words "I" and "me" consistently you positioned yourself as the primary teacher and left Ms. Hollocou out of the picture entirely.  Additionally Ms. Hollocou cut into the conversation twice to share ideas that she had heard students discussing.  The first time she said "I heard another important point Ms. Barrett.  Someone mentioned that it was very difficult to travel west."  The second time Ms. Hollocou cut in and said "Yeah I heard a lot of people giving more details to support the main idea 'It was difficult to travel west.'"  In neither case did you invite Ms. Hollocou to share what she had heard students discussing but instead left it up to her to find her way into the conversation. Please reframe Ms. Hollocou as an equal partner by considering the language that you use when you conduct the lesson and by either consulting with Ms. Hollocou briefly just before students turn back from a turn and talk or inviting her to share her noticings when the class conversation resumes.

Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the informal feedback that I sent you via email on April 9 2014:    You have diligently kept anecdotal notes on the students you service for ESL throughout the year.  Towards the end of my observation you began to write notes in this notebook.  This is a good way to keep track of what students are and are not mastering.  I noticed that you also jotted down some thoughts about possible next steps for each of the three students with whom you were working during my observation.  Be sure to go back to these notes as you plan your future lessons/work with each student.     You had some nice supports around the room for students to utilize.  For example you had information about writing a fact-based essay listed on the SmartBoard.  On the chalk board there was a chart showing five fingers and various linking or transition words that students could use in their writing.  As you move forward consider creating even more individualized supports.  For example Gustavo could use a mini-chart of the transition words that he could take with him and use in his other classes.  Ali and Laisha could use more structural or even initiation support so that they could work without constant verbal support from you.     It is evident that you are constantly working to develop your students' vocabularies.  You engaged Ali and Laisha in discussions about the words renewable and non-renewable.  You worked with Ali specifically on the prefix re-.  This is very important work.  Consider front loading the lesson with key vocabulary work in order to improve the flow of Ali's work.  Also a vocabulary support such as a re- word flashcard ring might be one way to reinforce the meaning of that prefix for Ali and Laisha.

0959574,2015,590085,2014-11-17 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Student behavior was appropriate throughout the observed period.    Students were being exposed to interesting content knowledge during the course of the period.    You worked to help Keryl recognize Spanish cognates such as intel in  intelligent as well as the Spanish word Junto meaning together.    Next Steps:    It is necessary for you to scaffold for students in more productive ways.  While you pointed out specific sections in the text for students and asked them very specific and step-by-step questions you need to instead consider ways to structure your lesson and tools that you can provide in order to help students be more independent learners.  In these ways they are likely to progress faster and more deeply understand the strategies and content at hand.  For example you might introduce just a few adjectives at the start of the lesson.  Teach these adjectives explicitly and ensure that when written down for your English Language Learners they are accompanied by pictures.  Using this method over time you can create a bank of adjectives that students truly understand and can use independently.  Additionally some students like Kenneth might benefit from having the task's directions written on a mini-chart step-by-step.  Alternately you can move the chart stand to a position that allows all students to look at it all the time.  Another tool that might prove helpful during a lesson like this one is an organizer that helps students identify specific text evidence and then draw inferences from these parts.    Scaffold your students' writing.  Begin by providing them with the thesis or claim and then teach and expect them to find the evidence to support this thesis or claim.  Once they have become very good at finding the evidence you can work to have them develop the claim or thesis on their own.
0959574,2015,670633,2015-01-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students were active and independent learners seeking out and utilizing resources on their own.    Students were active participants in the work of collaboratively describing and writing about the photograph.    The classroom atmosphere was consistently positive and focused on learning.    Next Steps:    Ensure that every lesson begins with you explicitly modeling the skill or strategy that you aim for students to understand or be able to successfully master by the conclusion of the lesson.  Avoid asking students questions to draw out a particular answer or product.    Introduce and explicitly model the use of all self-assessment tools so that students can actively and productively utilize them.    Always have a plan of attack for yourself during the independent work portion of the lesson.  Use the time deliberately and specifically to target individual students' known goals using prior or current work as your guide.    Pre-Observation Conference: We met for a pre-observation conference on January 5 2015.  During this meeting we discussed the elements of the NYSESLAT exam exactly what students are required to do during the written portion of the exam how you were working to prepare them for this part of the exam and how the observed lesson would reflect this work.    Post-Observation Conference: We met for a post-observation conference immediately following your return from maternity leave.
0959574,2015,735077,2015-05-22 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your use of conversation prompts effectively encouraged students to deepen their conversations.    Because students had prior experiences with food and ideas about healthy eating they were engaged in the reading and discussion.    Next Steps:    Ensure that your written lesson plans are aligned to match your teaching point(s).  Plan to explicitly model the teaching point (not just tell it) and have students practice the taught skill or strategy during the independent work period.      Always demonstrate exactly how you do something (in this case how you identify the central idea and supporting details).
0959574,2015,762979,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You took the feedback given to you on your most recent informal observation and utilized it as you planned and executed this observed lesson.    You created a chart that showed pictures of various foods from each food group.    You worked independently with Daniel on reading strategies.    Next Steps:    Write out the modeling portion of your lesson plan specifically.  In this way you will have done the most important thinking about how you will teach a specific skill or strategy really well.

We met for a post-observation conference on January 11 2016.    Highlights:    You are planning your guided reading lessons using a consistent structure.  Your plans reflect your efforts to appropriately scaffold students' initial understandings of the texts and develop higher levels of textual comprehension.    You asked open-ended comprehension questions to both groups of students that required them to infer and draw conclusions.  You consistently encouraged students to add on to each other's ideas and locate evidence to support their own answers.    It is evident that you are actively working to integrate your new learning about guided reading into your regular instruction.    Next Steps:    Be well-prepared to introduce vocabulary to the English Language Learners with whom you work.  Place post-it notes on the pages of your own book that contain the words you are planning to introduce.  Wherever possible prepare pictures to accompany the introduced words (e.g. pitcher & introduce).  Picture support can be helpful to students as they work to commit many words to their memory bank.    Always plan to demonstrate the strategy or teaching point to students.    Stop students when listening to them read independently as infrequently as possible.  Use the time to notice their reading and problem solving habits and then teach into these either at the end of the time that you listen in or at a future session or conference with them.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Your room is a very warm and inviting learning environment with helpful resources and reference charts.  You did an excellent job in setting up your room as a true classroom.      Next steps:    -When pulling groups that will require you to create subgroups develop a warm up or review activity that one group can work with while you work with the other.  Given that the groups you are pulling are ENL students it is critical that you develop their language and vocabulary.  I recommend word games that will focus on words from their high frequency word lists.  Independent reading without any graphic organizer or questions or other tool for them to show their thinking and hold themselves accountable may lead to passive participation and get easily distracted; which in this observation was the case for Houssein and Rae-Jelis.  Providing them with word games while you work with the other group will keep them engaged and can serve as a way to also front-load vocabulary and prepare for more complex reading.    Please consider games or warm up activities you could use with your students.  If you need assistance developing these please let me know so we can schedule some time to do so.  I'd like to hear your thoughts prior to our end of this school year.  Please send me an email or come meet with me to share the word games you are considering or have planned.

Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the informal written feedback that I provided you with on March 3 2014:     When I arrived students were just being dismissed from the carpet area.  They were dismissed at 10:24.  By 10:27 both you and Allison were working with small groups.  You have a system and schedule in place for small group work and appeared to be following that schedule.     You worked individually with Lianny one of the highest readers in your class.  You took notes as you worked with her.  You asked Lianny good questions to push her thinking such as "From what you're noticing what can you tell me about Eric's character?  What kind of description would you give him?"  When Lianny responded with "clumsy" you pushed her to provide evidence to prove he is clumsy asking "What makes you say he's clumsy" and "Where in the book shows that he is pretty clumsy?"  You continuously pushed Lianny to actually locate the text evidence.     There was little management of students' independent reading.  Although you and Allison were both working with groups just three minutes after students were released from the carpet at no time did either of you count down or expect students to be reading in their seats.  At 10:27 when you and Allison were seated with groups the room was extremely loud.  Analee was running around the classroom.  Seven other students were up walking around.  Seven other students were sitting at their seats but none of these students were reading.  Three students were at the back carpet book shopping.  At 10:28 Ms. Johnson was at the door trying to get three students who were standing up there back to their seats.  At 10:29 seven students were standing up and it was very loud.  At 10:30 six students were walking around the room and Juanita was reading aloud in almost a yelling voice.  Ms. Reynolds got up at this point to try to engage some students.  At 10:31 six students were reading independently and four students were up and moving about the room.  Ms. Stoney yelled to a student at a table across from her "Can you stop doing that?"  At 10:32 Ms. Reynolds sat down with her group on the rug.  Four students were walking/running around the room.  Ms. Stoney yelled to one of the students who was running around "Aren't you supposed to be reading?  So why are you making trouble instead?"  Then five students were up and yelling at each other.      By the end of this week please put the following into place:     At the start of the independent reading period you must have a routine in place for getting started before you begin your work with small groups.  For example you could set a timer for one minute after students are dismissed from the rug and set the expectation that students are all seated and reading by that time.  You could do the same by counting down visibly on your fingers.  There are several possibilities.  You will need to choose one and then explicitly teach it to your students and then repeatedly practice it.     Please ensure that you are tracking whole class reading stamina.  At the start of the year classes were consciously building the amount of time that they were independently reading each day.  This should continue as the year progresses.  Please return to this.     You should never sit with your back to the class.  In order to monitor behavior you must be able to see students constantly.  Please rearrange your small group meeting areas to ensure that this can be done.

Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,One idea I'm having that may help lead your students into thinking deeper about the math and their process is to ask them some why or how questions.  (e.g. How can you make your work clearer for others? Why did you choose to solve your problem this way?  How did that work for you?  Is there another way to solve this problem?)  Also consider questions like "how do you know?"  (for instance after the question "Is your money increasing or decreasing? you could ask "how do you know?  What does that mean to you?  etc.)  These kinds of questions prompt students to think more critically about their process and guide them into explaining their thinking thereby building conceptual understanding.  It is also a way for you to gather data on what level of understanding your students have and what/if any misconceptions or generalizations they be making that you may need to address.  In addition you should include a question in your current 4-step problem solving process that requires your students to critique and justify their thinking.  One example of this type of question is as follows "How can I prove I am correct?"  This was also suggested feedback during the November bulletin board review.      One idea I am having about how to equip yourself with strategies for these teachable moments is to consider the work you are doing with Ms. Maldonado and Ms. Hallan (the TC reading toolkits) and devising for yourself a math toolkit with strategies and manipulatives to help your students when they are stuck or confused.  One suggestion here is to discuss with Ms. Severino and Ms. Milliron possible misconceptions and "fix-it" strategies for the upcoming lessons during your weekly planning meetings.  We can discuss these strategies in the next couple of meetings and touch base on the impact the "tool-kit" is having on your students and your practice during the week of December 16th.
0989452,2014,158284,2014-02-25 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,CRUZ JESSICA,I enjoyed being a part of your class and observing some very strong pedagogical practices.  Below are two areas I want you to take a deeper look at:    -Your lesson plan does not include any form of assessment for this lesson.  There is an exit question listed in the "wrap up;" however it is unclear how these exit slips are being used. It is also unclear how students' learning would be monitored during "Independent work".    -Your system for tracking and monitoring student progress needs attention.  During my observation I didn't see any evidence of such a system which then raises the questions "how are groups being formed?  What data is being used to determine specific groupings and individual students' next steps?"  The one teach one observe co-teaching model is an excellent model to gather data during some of your mini lessons; particularly if one of you is leading the lesson.  In this way groupings will be more fluid and targeted.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You provided students with various well-placed supports including different types of paper cut up strips of paper that allowed students to easily add text to and delete text from their narratives and a list of high frequency words (Consider using the high frequency word lists that they are studying instead as these are more familiar and have larger text.  For these reasons these lists are likely to be easier for students to navigate independently.).    Next Steps:    Work to provide students with whom you are conferencing a strategy on which to focus relatively quickly.  Check for student understanding by asking this student to talk through his/her plan for the rest of the work period.  Following this move on to the next student.    Be mindful of how long students are seated and how productive the work time is for these students.  Be aware of student needs.  Develop systems for conferencing and "assistance-getting" during conference or small group work times.  Prepare paraprofessionals to assist by providing them with specific guidance or strategies ahead of time.

All four students with whom you were working had a strong grasp of how to draw rectangles as a strategy to compare fractions with like denominators.      Next Steps:    Be strategic about when you offer manipulatives.  Ensure that students know how to use the provided manipulatives and that the manipulatives are helpful for the problems at hand.  Work to link teaching points from one day to the next.    Always ensure that the assessment matches the taught skill or strategy.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    1) Your writing lesson plan demonstrates evidence of your understanding that all elements of the workshop must align to the teaching point.    2) You use reminding language consistently as a means to manage student behavior and maintain student focus on appropriate student behaviors.    3) You are aware of students' physiological needs deliberately intertwining movement breaks with more sedentary instructional work.    Next Steps:    1) Plan mid-workshop interruptions that support the teaching point with strategy.    2) Plan small group work according to student work analysis.  Plan strategy lessons or other process activities to support student understanding rather than scaffold or guide student completion of the assignment.    3) Use the share portion of the workshop deliberately.  Consider it another opportunity to teach.  Accordingly pre-plan (during the independent work period) who will share what will be shared and the point  you are trying to illustrate through the share.    Please submit your writing workshop lesson plans for the week of December 7th to me for review and feedback by Saturday December 5th.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,It was nice to see all of the adults in your class working with different groups of students during your writing poetry lesson.  Utilizing all adults in the room ensures that all students are being met with on a regular basis.    Overall what is missing in your lesson is students' active engagement in the learning process.  The group you were working with were heavily supported with questions throughout the entire process and were given suggestions of how to change their writing to make it better rather than provided with effective revision strategies to check for themselves how to make their poems read more like poetry.  I think what would support you in your writing conferences is to take a closer look at your questioning to guage whether your questions are asking students to think about their writing or your questions are indirectly giving them the "answers".  I would recommend using Bloom's Taxonomy to develop your questions for your writing conferences.  I am sending you a sample of the taxonomy in an email (since I cannot attach it here) so that you can use as you develop your questions.  Please submit to me a sample of your conference planning sheet for one of your writing lessons for next week so I can review.  Please share this with me by the end of this  week.  Should you prefer to work on it this weekend you can send it to me by Sunday afternoon as well.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Overall your work within small groups during this lesson reflected clear and explicit expectations of how one can tell a story bit by bit.  Your interaction with Makayla reflected how you pushed her to think deeper and more cohesively about her story.    Next Steps:   -When developing your lessons and your tools for students in your class it is important to consider everyone's present readiness levels so that your learning activities are cognitively challenging for everyone in your class regardless of where they are.  You need to be more explicit in your lesson plan on how you are challenging students and differentiating   the learning experience in order to do so.  More clearly designed plans will in turn be reflected in your actual lessons.  For example when you plan out the types of modifications or resources etc. you will use to challenge students then you will be better equipped with resources and materials to push students providing an equal level of intensity in their learning experience even though there isn't an equal (or same) approach to the learning.  I'd like to see any one lesson you plan for next week outlining or describing how you intend to differentiate or modify the learning experience for different learners.  These instructional decisions should be based off of the data/observational notes/conference notes you take during previous lessons.  I will review and provide feedback.

When students were talking or interruptions occurred you redirected them with a calm tone and firm language.    You facilitated a conversation during which students thought critically.  You asked open-ended questions pushing students to support their ideas with evidence and rephrasing students' thoughts.    Next Steps:    Be explicit both verbally and visually when you model the strategy that you are teaching.

The discussion on the rug forced students to think more deeply about how they understand a word problem and offered them a new strategy to add to their toolkit.  The Quick Shake was a fun brief chant that allowed all students to move have fun and build a positive rapport with numbers.  Additionally the circle time at the end of the lesson used a research-based approach to help students build number sense and fill in potential knowledge gaps.    Something to consider as you continue planning – how can you build assessment into your lesson structure?  Is there a capture tool you can use while on the rug and students are discussing a concept or something you can use during independent work time?  How can you gather more data on your students so that you have a clear sense of who has acquired the new skill or not?

0991648,2014,212078,2014-01-23 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the "feedback in-brief" that I gave you at our post-observation conference that was held on January 29 2014:    Highlights    The classroom was well organized.  When students arrived copies of the text that they needed for the mini-lesson were already placed in their table buckets.  Upon entering the room students were instructed to each take a copy of this text and bring it with them to the rug.  They did this extremely efficiently; the students entered the classroom at 10:52 and were seated with all of their materials by 10:53.  You had some helpful charts prepared for the class to reference.  One of the charts titled “When studying part of a mentor text it helps to ask:” offered strategies for critically analyzing a mentor text.    Your classroom was calm throughout the observed period.  Students were quiet and respectful to one another and yourself.  Your interactions with students were calm and focused.  Your expectations for diligent and hard work were clear.  Your expectations for student independence and accountability came through when you repeatedly told students that they would need to get ready to write the following day by researching their topics more fully that night for homework.    To Work On as You Move Forward    Students did many things during the observed class period.  They began by considering one focus topic that they might like to write about.  Later they read the mentor text and attempted to write down what they noticed about what the author did.  Finally at the conclusion of the period the students organized their notebooks so that they would be prepared with sections in which to write their books.  However these pieces were not cohesively introduced or modeled.  For this reason student work during the period was inconsistent and did not indicate a great deal of independent or new thinking.  Be sure that your lessons have focused mini-lessons with very clear teaching points and explicit teacher modeling.  In this lesson you seemed to be trying to prepare students to write their own books by engaging them in a critical examination of a mentor text and thought about some of the topics related to the American Revolution that they are most interested in.  In order to communicate this objective clearly consider starting the lesson with a very clear statement about what will be done that day and why.  For example you might begin by stating that “Today we are going to get ourselves ready to write our own books by looking at all the things that Niomi does to teach her readers about the American Revolution.  First watch as I think aloud about Niomi’s writing.”  At this point a very clear teacher model of how to look closely at what a writer does is imperative.  Judging from your chart and the feedback that students gave you likely want students to come away at the end of the lesson focused on: (a) how the author organized the text; (b) how the author introduced readers to key vocabulary; and (c) how the author “showed” readers what the key events were and how these events impacted the times.  Another way to ensure that the day’s objective and task is clearly communicated is to ask very specific questions and state very specific tasks.  For example instead of asking students to notice “what Niomi did” the overarching question for the day could be something like: “What did Niomi do as a writer that successfully teaches her readers about the American Revolution?”

It was exciting to see Johnell be so involved he almost missed his bus. :-)     You have been introducing your students to so many new content specific vocabulary (elements of nature culture food/survival).  It would be great for students to build a 3-D class model of an Iroquois society as they are learning about each specific element (e.g. bull rush deer hide vines harvest-wild onions garlicetc.)    I am also wondering whether ALL your students have captured sufficient information in their notes for each section reviewed in the film.  I say this because not all can write and process at the same pace and taking notes from multi-media can be a challenging skill.  One idea I am thinking of is perhaps Ms. Immediato could chart the facts students share out during the share to create a class reference chart that students struggling with note-taking can refer to and check their notes off of. I welcome your thought and/or ideas on this one.
0991648,2015,635088,2015-02-03 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students were aware of the writing self-checklist and actively taking initiative to utilize it.  Students I spoke to could explain how they were using it and why they had self-assessed in the ways they had.      Next Steps:    Model explicitly the skill or strategy you are working on.  Provide time for students to practice the modeled skill in pairs or small groups.  Move away from doing whole group work for the entire mini-lesson in order to ensure greater student engagement and deeper understanding.  While planning think about exactly what students may need to see modeled.  Consider what may be obvious or automatic to you and then take time to break down your process through explicit modeling to students.     Examine students' self-checklists during the course of the unit in order to plan for small group and/or one-to-one conference teaching points.  This will ensure more productive use of the writing rubrics.

You engaged students in annotating the texts.    Next Steps:    Prepare charts and other tools for student use ahead of time so that students do not need to spend time copying or creating charts (e.g. the three column chart into which students were organizing their evidence).    Deliberately plan strategy instruction for small groups.  Small group work should rarely if ever simply be a slower or hand-held version of the day's mini-lesson.  To work towards independence use the TCRWP reading progression to map the skills strategies and habits that students already have and utilize and identify sensible next steps.  Plan your small strategy groups with these as your teaching points.  Remember that the task or product does not need to be the same for all students.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,One thing I want to dig a little deeper on: at one point you asked students to pick heir reading spots and practice reading smarter.  Do all your students know what you mean by reading smarter?  This sounds like an excellent way to connect their individual reading goals to the process of becoming "smarter readers".  What work have you done around defining the "smarter reader"?  If this is not something you have done or thought about yet I encourage you to do so.  If you're interested in discussing this idea with me a bit further I welcome the conversation. :-)
0991648,2016,904214,2015-12-21 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students who participated in the play groups were extremely engaged when they were reading the texts.    You were attempting to have students think about different perspectives in history.    You provided a tool on which students could take and organize their notes setting them up to develop big ideas during future lessons.      Next Steps:    Develop specific teaching points that tell the what and the how.  Consider your desired outcomes as you develop these lesson plans.  Please submit one lesson plan for the week of February 29th to me for review and feedback by February 27th.    Develop and refine your bathrooming systems and routines.  Provide students with specific parameters for when they may use the bathroom and how they receive permission to use the bathroom.    Consider providing 15 minutes of uninterrupted work time before you call small groups for something else like the play.  Also consider meeting with groups away from the students who are working independently rather than in the middle of the room.    Carefully plan small group work for yourself and other adults in the classroom.    Always ensure that students are clear on the expectations for their work and have tools to monitor and check their own work.
0991648,2016,1029468,2016-04-22 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Overall your lesson reflects the deep understanding of big events and concepts in American history.  Kudos to you and facilitating such rich discussions around content.      Next steps:     -Plan for the adults in your room so that they are being utilized effectively and minimizing on the amount of downtime present. This will allow you to also focus on smaller groups of students rather than monitoring the class discussions and the individual students working on separate tasks.  I would recommend you look at Quintero's plans for how she plans for the adults or Barrett's lesson plans as they both do a really good job at planning this out and holding them accountable.     -Think about smaller activities/mini-projects that can be done in class to facilitate the leaning process for your students.  While your whole-class discussions are excellent and you provide a great deal of knowledge for your students lecture-style seems to be the primary way students are receiving this knowledge.  Remember you have lots of kinesthetic and visual learners in your classes who will need to see and experience what you are discussing to fully understand.  In addition as shown in Bloom's Taxonomy  "creating" is the highest level of demonstrating understanding and critical thinking.  If you'd like to brainstorm some of these min-projects/learning tasks with me let me know and I will schedule planning time together.  Or if there is another colleague you would like to do this type of work with let me know and I will schedule planning time.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    All observed and planned learning activities were cognitively challenging.    Structures were in place in your classroom that encouraged students' intellectual independence.    Students were consistently engaged in productive discourse.  They were prompted to explain their thinking support their thinking with textual evidence and purposefully respond to one another.    Next Steps:    When planning and teaching make the day's teaching point/learning objective explicit.
0991648,2017,1100910,2016-10-21 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You utilized the City Year corps member in your classroom effectively.  With you she conferenced with students about their writing.    The classroom environment was one in which students were comfortable working with each other and respectfully providing each other with feedback on their writing.    Students were actively engaged throughout the observed period.  Students knew the stage of the writing process they were currently in.  Student were aware of what they needed to do next and took steps to accomplish these tasks.    Students were aware of the assessment criteria for their personal essays.      Next Steps:    Upon my entry into the classroom Amare came over and said hi and volunteered what they were doing telling me that they were doing drafts and that he was writing about parcourt.  I pushed him to tell me what kind of writing he was doing.  He kept answering by saying that he was writing about parcourt.  I then went on to explain that some people write poems stories informational pieces.  Then I asked him what type of writing he was doing.  He could not tell me.  I asked him if he was doing an essay and he said yes.   I asked him what kind of essay it was.  He could not tell me even when I told him what a literary essay was.  Ensure that throughout a unit of study you are discussing the genre students are studying and writing.  Develop a timeline of units in your classroom with a sample of each genre available underneath for students to refer back to.    By 12/9 work with the 4th grade team (and consult with the 5th grade team as they have already developed some things) to develop grammar practice assignments that students can do if they find themselves sitting idly.  The focus of these at this stage of the year should be on capitalization and end punctuation.  The grade can include some explicit grammar instruction into morning messages or shared reading as well in order to support the independent practice work that you will be providing students.  In addition develop cards that students can use to indicate that they are working or that they are available to assist a peer.  These can be laminated and put on rings.  These might be nice to have across the grade as well.

1031175,2014,314702,2014-03-13 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the feedback in-brief with which I provided you at our post-observation conference that was held on March 27 2014:    Highlights    As students warmed up they moved their arms above their heads at shoulder height and straight down.  Simultaneously they chanted the words high middle low.  This total physical response strategy is a good way to develop students’ vocabulary.    Your room now includes words with pictures on your word wall rather than just words by themselves.  This too contributes positively to students’ vocabulary acquisition.    In order to help organize students you utilized rubber stars on the ground during the warm-up so that students would have a clear sense of where to sit.     The students did a very good job answering the question about when they have an inward focus outside of dance class.  This was a higher-level question that required children to transfer and apply their new knowledge of the term ‘inward focus.’  Answers that the students gave included “When you’re brushing your teeth;” “When you’re tying your shoes;” and “When you’re writing something.”    You have clear routines in place.  For example students know exactly how to get water quickly quietly and without argument.    To Work On as You Move Forward    Your mini-lesson largely consisted of asking students questions in a whole class call-and-response style.  For example you said “What did we learn about last dance class?”  Brandon: “A cannon.”  Mrs. Callender: “So that was the class before that…but I’m glad you remember that vocabulary word.”  Brayan: “Outward focus.”  Mrs. Callender: “Very good Brayan.  Who can tell me what outward focus is?”  Here there was a brief discussion about getting water.  Mrs. Callender: “Okay so outward focus is when you find something in the room and look at it and dance toward it.”  Here you showed a picture of outward focus.  Mrs. Callender: “Outward focus is when we look out at the room and find something.  Think for a minute.  Don’t yell out.  What do you think inward focus is?”  Shylah: “I think you like pay attention when someone’s doin something.”  Mrs. Callender: “Okay anyone else have an idea of what inward focus might be?”  Aanayla: “Close.”  Mrs. Callender: “Close to what?”  Aanayla: “The things around you.”  Mrs. Callender: “You’re getting warmer.  Anybody else?  Leana?”  Leana: “I don’t know.”  Mrs. Callender: “Okay inward focus is when you find something on your body or close to you.”  This became a bit of a guessing game and did not involve many students in the thinking.      Work to teach explicitly and involve as many students as possible in the thinking by giving them appropriate scaffolds and opportunities to think.  For example you might photocopy the outward and inward focus pictures on one page back-to-back labeling each.  Then you could hand them out to partners and say “Last week we learned about dancing with an outward focus.  Look at the picture that is labeled outward focus.  Notice how the child is looking out toward something in the room.  Hmmm now turn your papers over.  This picture shows a child who is focused inward.  With your partner use the picture and all that you know about outward focus to decide on a definition for inward focus.  Be ready to share your thinking in one minute.”  Then you can listen in to partnerships in order to get a sense of what the students are thinking clarifying when necessary.  After a minute you can say something like “I was listening in to Leana and Jaecee’s discussion and heard them talking about how outward and inward are opposites.  What were you all thinking?”  Let one or two pairs share.  Then “Okay so we’ve agreed that outward focus is when you look out and inward focus is when you look in.  Now with your partner name something that you could look at that would be an inward focus.”     While you did have the students talk to their partners at the end the prompt was low-level.  Students were asked to tell their partners which type of focus was their favorite and why.  While there is nothing wrong with this work to integrate universal opportunities for thought when higher level questions are asked as well.
1031175,2014,258192,2014-04-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,As always I truly enjoy watching you work with your students.  I noticed posted on your wall by the window you have the overarching understanding you want students to walk away with; "Creativity for group choreography.  Creativity-movements are unique they are not stolen from videos or other dances."  Following this you have two essential questions:  1-How has feedback helped you improve?  2-What makes a dance exciting to watch?    My only wondering here is how are you monitoring and assessing student growth with regard to the overarching understanding and their responses to these essential questions?  One idea I am thinking (not sure if you have tried this already) is to assign specific videos or choreography for students to assess and rate based on creativity movement and excitement (engagement).  These three ring very similar to what students look at in writing and reading during their ELA classes; author's voice author's purpose and word choice.  I would love to hear your ideas on this or other possible ways you are thinking to assess whether students not only grasped the choreography but also the overall concept of developing creative choreography.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights    -You utilized an audiorecording of a book about shapes to engage students build content knowledge about shapes and link dancing to both literature and math.    -You consistently utilized reminding language and logical consequences to solve problems quickly calmly firmly and respectfully.    Next Steps    -Consider quick and easy ways that you can get students to think about their own dancing/understanding and places that you can encourage them to think metacognitively.    -Work to engage more students intellectually by considering various scaffolds.  In this case a focus on vocabulary introduction or review and chunking the book into more manageable pieces are potential supports.

Your language around behavior is clear and to the point.  In this way students know exactly what to do and can follow through easily.    You actively reinforced acceptable interactions amongst students thereby encouraging a cooperative and respectful learning environment.    Students were consistently and genuinely caring and helpful to one another.    Students had opportunities to self- and peer-assess.    Next Steps:    As you move forward with the work of student self-reflection/assessment and peer assistance work on modeling for students how to begin the peer collaboration by naming for their partners exactly what they need help with.  Similarly teach and reinforce how to listen carefully to your partner's named difficulties and then provide related help and feedback.    We held a pre-observation conference on March 6 2015.  During our conference we discussed the fact that you were engaging Ms. Severino's class in a tap unit.  Although this unit is typically reserved for third graders you felt that it would be both appropriate and useful for this class since you are working with them for two semesters this school year.  We also discussed the objectives of your planned lesson: a) for students to learn a particular tap step and b) for students to take a risk and perform in front of everyone.    We held a post-observation conference on March 12 2015.  During this meeting you reflected on the lesson noting that you felt the students "did a good job assessing themselves" "did [the step] all by themselves and improved" and that "there was improvement from where we started and where we ended."

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students were eager for feedback from you and asked questions in order to solicit feedback and clarify.      Students assisted each other productively.    You encouraged the use of content area vocabulary when students were speaking.

You provided students with regular bite-sized feedback throughout the observed period.    You were proactive direct and calm when managing student behavior.    You actively seek professional learning opportunities for yourself.    You planned and asked a open-ended question designed to promote student thinking at the conclusion of the class period.    Next Steps:    1) Work on the wording of your questions when you plan balancing the open-endedness of them with language that will facilitate thought about the specific big idea at which you are aiming.  Additionally consider how you can quickly reword questions during class if it becomes apparent that students took the question in an unexpected direction.  Here too you'll want to work on still being open-ended but phrasing the question so that it can be more productively utilized to uncover the big idea you are aiming for students to understand.
1031175,2016,897942,2016-02-03 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,I thoroughly enjoyed your lesson.  It was wonderful to hear students use such rich vocabulary when brainstorming words beyond "amazing" to describe Jerome Robbins' work (e.g. feisty fearless flexible sharp smooth negative space etc.)    The work in your lesson is very similar to the work our upper elementary teachers are doing in the literature and art classes - they are working on identifying interpreting and comparing themes within texts.  It would be interesting to see how you can integrate some of the literacy language (theme central message universal understanding mood etc.) into your lessons.  I would be curious to see if this integration between both classes would help students better understand the concept of theme.  This is something worth looking into with your inquiry group.  What is your current inquiry?  Is there space for this type of work?    As for your next steps I am recommending the following two suggestions:   1.)  Integrate the use of a tracking tool during your group discussions as a way to monitor students' development with usage of content specific language critical thinking and interpretive skills and the ability to build on their ideas or off of the ideas of their peers during discussions (dance literacy).  This can be a checklist identifying the look fors in your lesson with three columns (e.g. gave a clear idea and fully supported it with specific dance vocabulary gave a clear idea but did not fully support it with specific dance vocabulary uses dance vocabulary but doesn't link it to a clear idea provided no idea nor examples with dance vocabulary).  I would recommend Ms. Maldonado as a partner to brainstorm such a checklist as she is very effective in devising tools to track student learning.  Once you have devised your tracker please share with me for feedback.     2.) Identify ways that are productive for Bouba to integrate into the lesson even though he may not be allowed to partake in the physical dance (due to religious reasons).  I am attaching some suggestions I pulled from the Dance Blueprint for Diverse Learners.  It is an excellent document for you to review as it provides many ideas supports and background information about students with special needs in the dance classroom.   "Strategies include sitting with a child and engaging in a parallel activity when the class work is overwhelm- ing; accompanying the class musically by playing a drum or shaker; helping to label distribute and collect materials; completing observational check lists targeting either specific skills or behavior (skipping balanc- ing time on task etc); reading a poem or story to the class that supports the lesson; taking photographs or videotaping ."  Please think about your upcoming unit for this class and identify ways you can engage Bouba into the learning withough physically having him engage in the movement.  Share the framework with me for feedback.      Here is the link to this document: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0ahUKEwiD1taVgOnKAhXBcT4KHbOHDLwQFggwMAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fschools.nyc.gov%2Foffices%2Fteachlearn%2Farts%2FBlueprints%2FDance%2520Spec%2520Ed%2520Supplement.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFebetsPeW_2PBintSI8pUPTSrz4A&bvm=bv.113370389d.cWw
1031175,2016,904728,2016-02-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your hard work and thoughtfulness as a dance teacher drama teacher choreographer and stage director came together in this year's musical Annie.  All students were engaged confident and independent on stage.  The show was exciting emotive and a showcase of what P.S. 154 students are truly capable of.  You brought out the best in our students.    You navigated your collaborative work with classroom teachers before and during the performance with professionalism.
1031175,2017,1077599,2016-10-17 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your knowledge of dance technique and the progression of pre-requisite knowledge for dance was clear during the warm-ups as well as your mini-lesson.    Both your written lesson plan and the enacted lesson were fully aligned with the stated teaching point for the day.    Your interactions with individual students and with the whole class served to develop a classroom environment wherein students were respectful to each other and to you.    Student behavior throughout the observed lesson was entirely appropriate.  Your swift and subtle moves served to manage minor disruptions successfully.    Students were very aware of the routines that have been established in your classroom.    Your lesson offered multiple and varied opportunities for students to engage with the new content.    Next Step:    Continue working to carefully plan the question that you pose to students at the end of the lesson.  While I didn't observe this in action your question for this day is written in your plan.  You wrote: "Why do you think it's important for you to know the difference between a symmetrical shape and an asymmetrical shape?  Why are we studying this?"  I would push you to consider a question that is embedded in a specific context or scenario such as "How might you use symmetry and asymmetry when you are dancing?"  OR "A choreographer is someone who decides upon the steps or body movements in a dance.  Why might a choreographer choose to use lots of symmetry?  Why might she choose to use lots of asymmetry when planning out her dance?"  Sometimes a question that seems simple such as "Why do you think it's important" is broad and abstract and thus hard to think about when there is no specific context given as I've done in the sample questions above.
1032699,2014,142087,2013-11-21 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the feedback in-brief that I gave to you at our post-observation conference held on November 27 2013:    Highlights    You have developed a culture of respect and rapport within your classroom community.  You spoke calmly to students at all times.  All students were diligent about staying focused on their work.  You complimented and reinforced the teaching point by highlighting the work that students were doing on various occasions.  For example you said “Nice.  So you’re actually asking a question.” During independent work you commented “I want to say I notice people using the room to…I’m also hearing a lot of students who are really coming up with wonderings.  They’re bursting with curiosity asking really good questions.”    At the start of the lesson you connected the class back to the work that was done the day before.  You stated “Good morning readers.  Yesterday we worked on places we should stop and think and talk and jot.  Now the first thing we did yesterday is we talked about and we worked on what we do when we learn new information…”  This connection to prior work helps to get students ready to take their thinking about their non-fiction texts another step forward.    To Work On as You Move Forward    Ensure that you are clear on the content before you teach it. Be sure to read the unit narrative ahead of time to understand exactly what the teaching points are all about. You taught students to “see a strong image” by having them find an “awesome photograph” in their text.  However for this teaching point we want to have readers reading text and picturing a strong image in their minds.  The other post-its that you had on your chart for this strategy had the starters “I’m picturing…” and “I’m also picturing…”  These also focus on the reader envisioning what is being described in the text.    Demonstrate strategies using text rather than pictures so that students will also be inclined to use the strategies as they read text.  For example when you demonstrated the strategy of asking questions you only demonstrated asking a question about a picture.  While there was text around the picture you did not refer to any of the text.  Next you asked the students to turn and talk about a picture on another page.  No text on the page was read aloud to them.  Text is information and stimulates even more questions.  Reading aloud the text during the demo and active engagement gives them opportunities to integrate new information into their already present schemata about a particular topic.    The work that you do must meet students where they are.  Students must be reading on their levels for many minutes a day.  During this lesson Alberto Anesxa Kisandra read for periods of time.  Alberto and Anesxa however also spent a long time sketching pictures from the book.  No guided reading or small group work occurred.  No guided reading schedule was visible to me.    The original observation report was completed in Advance on February 21 2014.  Due to the February vacation schedule you were given the observation report on the day that we returned from vacation Monday February 24 2014.  You and I met on March 31 2014 at your request to discuss the observation.  On April 11 2014 you submitted a set of reflections and responses to the observation report.  You also submitted the original observation report unsigned.
1032699,2014,147927,2014-01-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,When conferring with Alberto you identified a few things you wanted him to work on that are specific to his writing piece.  After discussing them with him you had to sit with him to monitor he was making the changes and revisions discussed.  Consider how you can structure the conference in a way that provides students with clear next steps and focuses on skills that are transferable without relying on teacher guidance.      One idea is providing him with a post it of the techniques revisions strategies you want him to work on.  I also recommend narrowing down the number of techniques/revisions/strategies given in one conference as it may be overload and can result in your student just complying with the steps as opposed to internalizing them as things good writers do or processes good writers go through.  Another idea is to have him practice on the strategy you are teaching with multiple short writing samples before asking him to do it on his own.    One last quick point from this observation; there seems to be a lot of stimuli at the front of your room (charts covering the entire board) and therefore it is difficult to identify what the current teaching point and resources are that students should be referring to.  Please ensure that your anchor charts process charts and/or teaching point charts are clearly displayed at the front of your room and any additional charts you still have your students refer to (from previous lessons/units) are displayed along the room but not beside the ones being currently used as it is all consuming.  I will follow up with a brief visit on Wednesday January 15th to see your progress with this and provide additional feedback if needed.    I welcome the dialogue of your observation and look forward to hearing about any additional ideas you may have on how to make your conferences with students more explicit and focused on specific transferable skills.
1032699,2014,219686,2014-03-27 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,-It was a pleasure to see you work one-on-one with your student and guide him through the process from generating ideas to drafting.      --While you were actively monitoring John's writing development and his level of mastery with regard to writing supporting details in his paragraphs I did not observe you documenting the progress and strategies taught.  Please ensure you are tracking student progress while you monitor their learning during your conferences.  In this way you will have hard data to analyze when assessing student growth and evaluating student mastery.  You can refer to your USB for sample conference notes if you are in need of a template.    -In regards to your lesson planing your differentiation column just lists tools you will use or activities students will engage in but it doesn't explicitly state who these tools/activities are for so the assumption is this is intended for your entire class.  Therefore it isn't really differentiation.  Please be clearer in your lesson plans how you are differentiating for your diverse learners and how you are assessing they meet the instructional outcome.
1032699,2014,368276,2014-04-23 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,The lesson plan that you submitted to me for this lesson was:    Teaching Point: "Good writers evaluate choices and draft essay."    Modeling: "Use my anchor piece.  Review my bubble map out loud.  We options out loud.  Make choices with my students."    Active Engagement: "The power of persuasion!  So much fun right! Let's make this trip happen."     Independent Work: "Help with choices if necessary.  Drafting.  Building writing stamina!!"    Differentiation: "Acting out persuasion.  Partner switch.  Informal assess."

1052046,2014,86404,2013-12-17 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,Overall your lesson plan is lacking a structure that clearly depicts your instructional purpose and the pedagogical approaches for your intended goal. Instead you had a bulleted list of 7 steps.  This essentially reads as a to-do list rather than an actual plan of instruction.  Your lesson plan needs to include the following components:   -what your instructional purpose/goal is   -how you will explicitly teach the strategy or skill   -an explicit description of the planned guided practice   -what your students will do in the independent practice that will support the instructional outcome  -how you will assess or monitor student progress (whether formative or summative)   -what differentiation you strategically plan in order to provide supports for individual students leading to the instructional outcome.     You have a section in your lesson plan that identifies the SIOP features that will be evident in each lesson.  These features address instructional decisions you would make based on data from your students and encompass the following categories: preparation scaffolding grouping options integration of processes application and assessment.  For this lesson you selected 23 of the 24 features.  While it is a good idea to identify what SIOP features you are focusing on in your lesson you want to be strategic and purposeful in your selection and be clear and explicit on how these features are being implemented in your instruction.  For example if you select individual and group as forms of assessments your lesson plan should read with an explanation of these assessments who is being assessed and how you are monitoring progress.      Lastly when thinking about the instructional outcome for your lesson consider how the strategy you are teaching and the activities students are engaging in are linked to big learning outcomes rather than simply tasks or activities (e.g. Content objective: students can identify the correct sequence of events detailed in a poem.  Language objective: students can write phrases from the poem for understanding using rhymes.) When writing your objectives think about what students are doing and why.  The "why" should be what links your task to the learning outcome.    As a resource for lesson planning please visit the USB that was provided at the beginning of the year.  There you will find templates that while not mandated to use are very helpful tools for planning.  In addition visit the following link located on the NYCDOE website:  4Teachers Resources.  This site provides vital information for ESL teachers and includes sample lesson plans for you to review. Please submit one lesson plan you intend to teach next week for my review and feedback by no later than Monday January 14th.
1052046,2014,142750,2014-01-15 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the feedback in-brief that I sent to you on January 20 2014:    The word wall in your classroom is well done. The words are often accompanied by helpful pictures.    Throughout the independent work period that I observed many students were not engaged in the work that you asked them to do. When I arrived Eliel Houssain and Jeter were talking. Their books were closed. Eliel said "I got two bad guys and that's it." Houssain continued "Oooh you know the crabs?" Eliel: "And they don't really hurt." At 10:05 Mahamadou and Victor were sword fighting with their writing utensils on the rug. Jonathan was walking around the room. Rama was making very loud noises. I asked her to get up and sit next to me.     You asked students to complete a hand written worksheet that you copied from the Santillana textbook. According to your lesson plan you wanted students to be able to use the vocabulary that you listed on your lesson plan correctly and interpret a bar graph. What specific speaking listening writing or math CCLS standards did this lesson address? The hand drawn blank graph that you drew is very confusing. Think about doing a much more authentic project that engages students in more rigorous reading writing and speaking. Consider the current writing units of the 1st and 2nd graders as you plan. It is also imperative that you engage your students in regular guided reading lessons. You have been attending TCRWP demo lessons and professional development sessions related to guided reading. Please work to integrate this work into your lessons immediately. There are resources in the library and my office. Please know your students' current levels as you plan guided reading lessons for them.

I also wanted to briefly highlight another noticing.  While your students shared their ideas a number of them continued to reference people or places in the text with "him" and "there".  You repeatedly asked them to be clear and specific when they reference people and places and to state who they were referring to with "he" and where they referred to with "there".  This is a great way to ensure students are speaking (and in turn) writing with detail clarity and elaboration.  Kudos to you!

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You asked questions that encouraged students to think about character traits and vocabulary.    You encouraged students to justify their ideas with evidence from the text.    You encouraged students to respond to one another using the starters "I agree" and "I disagree."    Next Steps:    Restructure your read aloud sessions so that you can read more text (2 - 3 chapters at a time) and give children opportunities to face each other while talking.  Work to have children select each other to talk.  Now that students easily use "I agree" and "I disagree" begin introducing and using other second grade talk prompts more regularly.    When I entered the classroom Ms. Yvelisse (YMCA) was yelling at the class.  Please ensure that all adults who work in your classroom are respectful at all times of students and recognize them as young children.  Rarely should yelling be used as a method.  Reserve a raised voice for dangerous or out-of-control situations that require immediate attention-getting.  Work to have all adults utilize Responsive Classroom teacher language and logical consequence techniques.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Overall it seems that your practice in lesson planning is having a negative impact on the execution of your plans and on your practice as a whole.  I am requesting that you submit two math lesson plans for this week for feedback.  I will need the plans by Tuesday afternoon in order to have ample time to provide you with feedback and give you time to make necessary modifications.  Please ensure that prior to sending me your plans you have already included the following: your objective how you plan to teach it what learning experience you will be providing your students (or group of students) and how you plan to assess/monitor learning.
1267388,2016,930117,2016-02-09 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,During this observation it was evident that your students enjoy working with you.  They feel comfortable asking you questions or asking you for guidance.    You did a nice job self-correcting yourself in front of them when you realized your explanation and your model were inaccurate and a bit confusing to them.  This helps children see that it is ok to make a mistake as long as they can think of ways to work through their mistake.     Next Steps:    -Your biggest struggle seems to be in your planning and preparation.  You are developing learning experiences that don't necessarily match students' readiness levels and therefore; reflect the lack of data that is being used to make instructional decisions.  That being said  I want you to focus your work for your next unit of study on matching the purpose of each of your lesson plans to your students' readiness levels.  In order to do this you will need to look at the CCLS (math) and identify where each of your students falls within the progression of the standards.  This will help you identify your starting point for each student.   Then look at the overarching understandings big concepts and major skills students will need for that unit.  Compare the two in order to determine where your students will start and make realistic projections of how deep into the concept you will go.  While you are working with a small population of the class there should still be differentiation in your approach to each of these learners.  Let's meet on Monday April 4th to review both your student analysis and the framework for your upcoming math unit.      -In regards to preparation I am also recommending that you work on developing a deeper conceptual understanding of the mathematics prior to teaching future concepts.  As discussed in your post-observation your students left this lesson with little to no understanding of what the denominator represents in a fraction. This is due in large part to the fact that you repeatedly focused on the procedure of adding fractions with like denominators and made no mention or had no discussion as to why the denominator doesn't change.  In fact given your approach to this lesson you also provided confusion to your students by drawing two separate models but referring to the combination of these two parts from the same whole. The following site is an excellent resource to refer to in order to build deeper conceptual understanding (https://www.khanacademy.org/) but of course you are not limited to just this one.  As a support to this as well I would recommend taking the post assessment you intend on using with your students (after you've reviewed and modified based on your unit framework) so that you can identify all the skills strategies and facts your students should know in order to tackle the math presented to them.  Each of these should be included in your framework as specific teaching points if needed.  On April 4th we will work through this as well.  Please come prepared with your students' standards-based analyses drafted upcoming unit framework and your potential post assessment (completed).  We will use all of these to flesh out your teaching points and individual supports.
1267388,2016,981945,2016-03-31 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    A clear teaching point was evident.    You listened attentively to Daniel and integrated his thoughts into the conversation demonstrating genuine care and respect for him.    Next Steps:    Always name the teaching point at the beginning of the conference and model a specific strategy to utilize.    Phrase questions in an open-ended manner.  Teach explicitly (State teaching point and model strategy) rather than using yes/no or either/or questions to move the conference/lesson forward.
1267388,2016,1003944,2016-05-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Next Steps:    Carefully analyze student work and plan your small group instruction according to this analysis.    Clearly model the how.  As often as possible accompany your talk with visual supports and meaningful opportunities for students to practice before working independently.    Ensure your own clarity with the content you are teaching before you teach the lesson.    Other notes:    I arrived in the classroom at 8:53.  The class and content area teacher Mrs. Quintero were in the classroom.  Mrs. Quintero was conducting the mini-lesson.  When I asked Mrs. Quintero where you were she stated that she did not know where you were.  At 8:55 you walked in the room with Chasity who reportedly had gone to the nurse.  Please ensure that you are always present and active during teaching time.  Moreover please ensure that your co-teacher always knows where you are.
1285142,2014,144934,2013-12-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the feedback with which I provided you at our post-observation conference on January 15 2014:     Highlights    You and Mrs. Reid very effectively used a duet teaching model.  You seamlessly used each other to ask what happened and why locate the information in the text and write it down on a chart for students to see.  It was so seamless that two students even chimed in easily.  Nehemiah substituted the word ‘flood’ for ‘swamped’ and Mahamadou pointed out that the land will flood if the sea levels rise too much.     You repeatedly asked students to identify evidence in the text to support their thinking.  For example you asked Jiovanni during the mini-lesson “Can you tell me which sentence in that paragraph tells you that they will be endangered?”  He responded “Because it says that their food supply will be cut off.”  Later you said to the class “So I want you to tell me exactly what’s gonna happen.  Use the text.”    To Work On as You Move Forward    I didn’t notice any students actually referring to and utilizing the mini-charts during the independent work portion of the lesson.  While you mentioned it briefly during the mini-lesson you did not say anything more.  Students were likely not clear on how when or why they could utilize the chart.  Explicitly refer to or utilize this during the teaching portion of the mini-lesson in order to encourage student use during independent work. In addition please be sure that everything you hand out to students is correctly spelled.  In the mini-chart you handed out to students the word ‘your’ was misspelled.  It should be “As you’re reading…”  It is imperative that we model good spelling and grammar for our students at all times.    While you worked with a small group only reteach work was done with them.  That is to say that the lesson on cause and effect was simply retaught or reviewed.  Remember that small group work should be planned ahead using student work and other big skills should be addressed.  I also didn’t see any conference notes taken during the small group work.  How will you keep track of what was accomplished and thus determine where to go next with these students?

This provided opportunities for more targeted instruction.    Your interactions with students demonstrated care and respect.  The students with whom you were working were calm comfortable and engaged.    Next Steps:    Be aware of which students you are posing questions to and thus how much you are actually learning about each individual student's understanding or mastery.  Deliberately work to check for understanding and mastery levels of all students rather than those who are nearest to you or most vocal.    Provide regular opportunities for students to self-assess.    In addition to asking factual recall questions work to also ask questions that have more than one possible answer.  Additionally provide opportunities for students to explain their answers linking their answers to big ideas or details to thesis statements.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You worked to make the text "Rats and Their Ratty Ways" accessible to students who were not at that reading level by providing a bullet-pointed summary of the text and captioned pictures.    Students were actively engaged in annotating texts with P for positive and N for negative.  This type of task is cognitively rigorous.    Next Steps:    Be sure that the type of Thinking Map you use matches the genre and goal of the work.
1285142,2016,896769,2016-01-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,I thoroughly enjoyed visiting your class and watching you and Ms. Hallan guide students through a learning experience that challenged them to think about the types of questions good researchers ask.  :-)     It was evident in this observation that you and Hallan communicate regularly about your learning experiences.  I would love to have the fourth grade Ri team come do an inter-visitation of your class. Please provide me with a few possible lessons I could schedule them for before you get into the test prep unit.     Your next steps:   In regards to your lesson planning more clarity is needed as to how you are intentionally planning to meet the needs of individual learners.  Please be more specific in your plans as to how you are differentiating the learning experience for different students or groups of students and how you are going to measure their success and monitor their progress.   Currently your plan only includes the names of the students who will be in specific groups but it isn't clear why these groups are created what the expectation is for the group and how their engagement in the learning experience will differ from the rest.  This should be clearer in your plans.  Please elaborate on your small groups/differentiation section in your plan.  This will be revisited and looked at closely during our next visits to your classroom.
1285142,2016,965559,2016-03-15 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your written lesson plan and enacted lesson followed a purposeful order.  All elements of the lesson were well-aligned to the stated teaching point.      Students had opportunities to engage in the work themselves as you appropriately balanced the shared experience with much-needed time to practice the strategies independently.    You have established an academic environment in which students are very comfortable sharing their knowledge and taking intellectual risks.    There are clear systems and routines in place.    You gave students back their previously-taken multiple choice quizzes a nice way of allowing them to track their own progress.        Next Steps:    Differentiate the mini-charts that students reading far below grade level utilize so that they include less text and more illustrations (see Smarter Charts K - 2).    When quizzes are given back always conference with students about one area of challenge.  In this way students are not left to make meaning of the right and wrong answers on their own.
1285142,2016,966087,2016-04-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,It was enjoyable observing you engage your students in math talk.  You posed a very interesting question for them to think about and discuss; which was "what is half of 9?"  You also provided nice scaffolds asking them to think about half of 8 and half of 10.  When you saw them begin to struggle with this big idea you told them "we'll come back to this later."  You set the stage nicely for them to engage in productive struggle and then pulled back.  I would have loved to see you pushing them to work through it a bit more.  You could provide real examples (e.g. 9 cookies) for them to explore with and work out what is half of 9.  This should be your next step.     Develop another challenge question for your students (or perhaps go back to this one) and provide space time and manipulatives for them to explore the concept a bit more.  Take anecdoatal notes of their conversations listing misconceptions generalizations and key ideas and words they are demonstrating awareness (or even mastery of).  We can discuss some of the trends in these misconceptions and generalizations; these essentially will potentially become your next teaching points.  This is also data that can be brought to the inquiry team for further investigation.  Let me know if you'd like to sit and discuss or plan this learning experience together.  I recommend using Bloom's Taxonomy as a resource to help you develop the questions and the scaffolds for this learning experience.  I will attach a copy for your reference to this observation.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You clearly stated the day's task at the beginning of the session.    You worked to ask open-ended questions as a way to encourage students' active intellectual engagement.    Next Steps:    Ensure that all students adequately understand the task before sending them off to work in partnerships or independently.  Model when necessary so that all students can engage purposefully in the task.

Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the "feedback in-brief" with which I provided you following our post-observation conference on February 4 2014:    Highlights    You and Jose did a nice job duet teaching.  Your role was one of delivering the teaching point while Jose’s role was one of discussing in greater depth the nuances of the poem’s lines.    The students in your guided reading group were highly engaged.  They were able to give textual evidence on several occasions to support their ideas about the problems and solutions.  You continuously encouraged students to support their answers with text evidence saying things like “I want you to use text evidence.  It’s good to make predictions but I want you to be able to use evidence from the book” AND “Okay so for the problem and the solution what did you see in the book that made you say that and what are the page numbers?  Remember we have to back up our ideas okay?”    You and other adults in the room consistently helped organize and focus particular students.  For example Bella and Jose’ pointed to particular lines in poems that you were discussing during the mini-lesson for individual students.  At the conclusion of the lesson when Jose’ was going over some of the poems you placed the poems in front of Sevan and directed him to them.    To Work On as You Move Forward    Provide written directions for the independent work assignment somewhere.  You gave the directions orally but I was unable to record everything you said.  Then I was unsure what the students were supposed to be working on.  If I was unsure what was supposed to be done it is likely that many students were unsure of the assignment as well.    Bella (City Year volunteer) walked around without aim or purpose during the independent work period.  Please be sure that you’ve planned so that all adults in your classroom are being used effectively at all times.    I am unclear about the purpose of having the students read aloud during the guided reading group.  If the group is working on fluency consider other activities like audio recording their reading or reading aloud to a partner and having their partner critique and assess.  The focus of this guided reading group however appeared to be comprehension (specifically identifying the problem and solution).  That being said Derek was engaged once he began to read aloud.  Reading aloud enabled you to more easily monitor his engagement.  To consider here though is how you can build both his and the other students’ silent reading stamina since this is what their current reading levels require them to bolster.    Consider how you monitor students’ understanding of the taught literary device.  When asked what she was doing Arlenys pointed out a quote that she wrote down as an example of two things being compared.  The quote she wrote was “The reason I like chocolate is I can lick my fingers and nobody tells me I’m not polite.  I especially like scary movies ‘cause I can snuggle with Mommy or my big sister and they don’t laugh.”  Arlenys told me that “they’re comparing chocolate and scary movies.”    How do you monitor the needs of the students in your guided reading group?  I saw you taking notes on a post-it but am not sure what was being recorded or how these notes impacted subsequent instructional choices.  For example I noted in my notes that Sevan was having trouble differentiating between though and through.  Consider having him do some sight word drill with these two words pointing out the r and how that letter changes the word ahead of time.  City Year could quiz him each day.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your written lesson plan is consistently aligned to the stated teaching point.    You made efforts to engage Tahirah in the work (e.g. allowing her to choose the text and having her write down her goal for the week).    Next Steps:    Carefully consider whether the skill that you have in mind to teach will correspond with the books that you offer as choices.    Cut down on the amount of writing that you engage students in when working on reading in order to maximize volume and build stamina.  Consider the purpose and benefits of all writing that occurs during reading in order to decide what writing is worth spending time on.    Work to actively engage students in the process of goal-setting.

You were clear direct firm and kind with your behavioral expectations.    You demonstrate consistent effort to improve your own practice and contribute to the learning and development of your colleagues.    Next Steps:    Always provide students with a clear introduction to the work ahead even during a shared experience when there is not a defined mini-lesson.    Be cognizant of the types of support that you are providing students.  Always provide clear visual support as you talk through skills strategies or content.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,You were amazing and you provided a culturally rich experience for students through a highly multi-sensory approach that piqued so many students' interest and maintained their engagement! Awesome job.    Next steps:   -Ensure you're facilitating the learning through the use of intentional questioning.  I am recommending you take your teaching point and convert it into a question you can use to gauge student understanding and assess student learning.  In this case the question could be "How are South Korea and America similar and different at the same time?"  As you continue to prepare your lessons for your small groups work to rephrase your teaching point into a question (perhaps an exit question) for you to track students' understanding and progress.
1351650,2014,114100,2013-11-08 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,-After your mini-lesson you had your students turn and talk about the important words they want to highlight in their books to include in their indices.  Based on the conversations I heard some of your students were able to articulate words they feel are important and worth including in their index while others either struggled to identify their important words or did not get to share at all.  One suggestion that may have helped your students think about the words they would like to include in their index is to actually have their books present during the mini-lesson.  After your model you could have provided them with time to review their books and think of words they would like to highlight as important words.  In future writing lessons ensure your students have their work present if you are going to ask them to practice the given strategy/skill with their own work.     -I want you to consider your current strategy for determining whether students know and understand what to do (e.g. thumbs up sideways or down).  While you may be able to get a quick read of your group's understanding the information you're gathering may not adequately represent your students true understanding.  Some children may put a thumb up because they don't want to be the ones not to "get it".  Some students may even put their thumb up because they do believe they understand but their understanding may be inaccurate.  One idea I am having is after your students have discussed with their partners have them write one "important word" they have chosen on an index card (or little white boards) to share with the group.  This will give you a quick assessment of whether your students can differentiate between important words for their book topics from common words used in their books.      -When designing modifications to your task/lesson/unit consider the reason for your modification as well as the overall goal for your students.  For instance one modification you made to the task was to ask one group to identify five words to include in their indices while the other group was told to choose four.  If students have high frustration levels and low attention spans then modifying by quantity may benefit.  However if students need modifications due to processing issues then you should consider tools templates and graphic organizers to help them monitor their understanding through their thinking process
1351650,2014,145252,2014-01-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,-During independent practice you pulled a small group for a guided reading lesson. While you pulled Augustine Myesha and Princess to the carpet you worked with each one independently on different goals. It is unclear as to why you pulled these students together and what strategy or tool you intended to guide them with.  When reviewing your lesson plan to get a clearer picture of your instructional purpose there was no evidence there of your intention or goal with your guided reading group.  I notice your efforts in making your lesson plans clearer; you've changed the format and have included more details for each section of your lesson.  Your next step is to actually plan out your guided reading work; particularly since you have expressed in the past your struggle with guided reading.  I recommend sending me your plan for your next guided reading lesson so I can provide feedback to you.  You should also be making use of your guided reading toolkit when working with these small groups.  I highly recommend you take a look at Ms. Maldonado or Ms. Grant's toolkit for additional ideas on strategies and tools to use during guided reading.      I look forward to hearing other ideas you're having on how to strengthen your model and your guided reading work.
1351650,2014,271279,2014-02-25 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the informal feedback that I sent you via email on March 4 2014:    When I arrived Ms. Bakst was teaching the mini-lesson while you were assisting.  You were seated on the rug refocusing Jeremy who was seated next to you and talking with the students who surrounded you during the turn and talk.  It is expected that you are using varied co-teaching models consistently.  This does not mean that you can never use the "one teach one assist" model but it does mean that this should not be the only or even most used model.  You have some wonderful technology that you and Elana can alternate using.  Many of your students are functioning well below grade level and would benefit from a different teaching point altogether (e.g. think superpowers units from the K and 1st grade reading units for your A - D readers).  Having two teachers in the room can make this kind of highly differentiated work possible.     When Ms. Bakst dismissed the students from the carpet (9:46 a.m.) to transition to the independent work period you went to the back of the room and searched through a bucket for some books.  At 9:47 you were looking around the room.  Ms. Bakst did not announce the names of the students who were going to be in your group as she dismissed students from the rug (though she did announce the names of the students she was going to be working with).  You selected students and called them to come work with you on the back carpet until 9:49 a.m.     When your guided reading group gathered on the back carpet you distributed the books and then said "We're going to start this book again and we're going to focus still a lot on our fluency.  We read Chapter 1 but did we read more?"  A student replied "We're on Chapter 2."  You said "Yeah that's what I thought."  If you are meeting consistently with your guided reading groups there should not be a need for you to reread chapters.  In addition and potentially more importantly you should have notes from the previous meeting that you've used to plan for the upcoming session.  The notes should detail how far the group read during the previous meeting so that there is no question or wasted time during the current session.     You got your guided reading session going by stating "Alright so I'm going to read the first page of Chapter 2 and then I'm going to come around and listen to you."  You need to give students a focus question/prompt.  For example "Today we're going to read the second chapter.  As you're reading try to notice the problem that is developing.  We'll discuss this problem at the end."  This gives students a purpose as they engage in the day's reading.     Finally time ran out however you did not provide any whole group teaching point at the end of the guided reading lesson.  Please research for a common thread of need during the independent reading portion of the guided reading group and present a teaching point at the conclusion of the lesson.  Please see attached for a planning template you should utilize.  You need to utilize the TCRWP guide for skills strategies and habit as they relate to particular reading levels as you plan and instruct.  I have also attached this once again.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your questions and prompts encouraged Anise to think and do independently.  She was an active learner and her true understanding of the work showed at the end when she was able to complete problems easily explaining along the way exactly what she was doing.    You were caring and respectful while working with Anise.    Next Steps:    Ensure that you prepare differentiated exit questions so that the work students do at the end of class matches what they've done during class.  You can always have a few exit questions without the fractions filled in so that you could fill them in with appropriate numbers at the end of class (if what you actually did with particular students differed from what you planned to do).

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    During your interactions with individual students you worked hard to encourage students to give meaningful and specific feedback to each other.    You were responsive with your instructional moves when you noticed that students were not understanding the concepts of precision and accuracy.      Next Steps:    Prior to each lesson consider how you can and plan to best support and scaffold student understanding.  Visual supports up-front small group lessons and mini-charts (in this case perhaps a chart showing the word definitions and an example of good feedback) are some examples of potential supports.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You pre-planned two different supports for students and intended to use them on the day of this observation.  In planning the supports you were thoughtful about the type of challenges students might run into.    Next Steps:    Always be prepared to explicitly teach a small group a strategy.  It is helpful to carry a toolkit of various mini-charts and texts that you can turn to whenever necessary to teach various common skills and strategies.  It is necessary to be prepared in this way because students who are struggling with a particular concept skill or strategy are not going to develop a deeper understanding of a concept only by hearing it again or being guided by a series of questions.  Rather they need a tangible strategy to use as a means to help them unlock challenging skills such as identifying a main idea.    Consider using a boxes and bullets strategy to help students identify the main idea.  Since they are familiar with boxes and bullets teaching the structure will not be necessary however teaching students how to use boxes and bullets to test whether or not they have correctly identified the main idea will be necessary.  Provide students with a small blank boxes and bullets structure (just one box and three bullets).  Around the outside of the box make sure you label it with something like "Make sure this is a complete sentence!"  Then show students how you test out your ideas for a main idea by either saying it to yourself (preferable given the amount of time it will take them to write down different main idea possibilities) or writing it down in the box and then seeing if you have other details to prove that the main idea is true.  If you do not then it cannot be the main idea.
1351650,2016,923048,2016-02-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:     You were working to engage students in some cognitively demanding literacy content.  Jeremiah in particular and Johnell at times were engaged in some extremely high level thinking.  Jeremiah was so engaged that he publicly commented on how "powerful" he felt as a learner.     You effectively redirected student behavior.    You tracked student understanding over time with a checklist.    You are an active and engaged member of your inquiry team.    Next Steps:    Always pre-plan how you will explicitly model and teach skills strategies content or concepts.  You and Mr. Fernandez put effort into creating an organizing sheet for the students to use on this day but your plan for what you will do and say as it relates to each literary device is absent.    Be responsive to students' needs and change your course of action when necessary.  When your checklist or notes and/or students' comments and work during a lesson evidence a lack of understanding slow down and go deeper rather than moving forward to the next concept.    Consider a more nuanced tracking system that can more accurately capture students' understanding of concepts or mastery of skills and strategies.  Alternately or additionally take notes that highlight the gaps in students' understanding.
1351650,2016,960088,2016-04-04 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Thank you for your reflection.  It helped me better understand your thought process.  While I observed your lesson many of your students seemed to thoroughly enjoy the story The Circuit.  You also handled the explanation of the exerpt in the book where the young boy relieves himself in his hands very calmly and lightheartedly.  The students laughed along with you making them comfortable and enjoying the text (even the more uncomfortable parts) together.  In fact when Aleja made a face showing she was grossed out you reassured her you weren't intending on grossing her out but wanted her to understand the character's choices and perseverance.  Kudos to you!    Based on both what I observed and read in your lesson plan and reflection it is clear that more thought is needed around providing opportunities and resources students can use to access the curriculum.  Your lesson plan/resources should reflect deliberate considerations and modifications that allow students to access the text process the information and ultimately build big ideas about what they are reading.  As you continue your read aloud of this text please prepare tools that would support your students with limited language or language barriers with processing issues ad/or disabilities.  You should provide a word list with visuals for the chapter you are reading (these wordlists can be attached over time to essentially become a glossary for students) as well as a tool where they can chunk and summarize before tackling the claim.  Please let me know if you'd like to discuss some of these recommended supports further.  I'd like to see what resources you come up with so please share them with me by end of week next week (4/15/16).

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You differentiated two articles used as research resources adding in bold words tables and subtitles all text features more typically found in transitional level non-fiction texts.    You provided students with an alternate note-taking strategy.    You immediately brought Justin up-to-speed when he entered the classroom late.      Next Steps:    When planning all lessons carefully consider the co-teaching model that you will utilize as it relates to the day's content goals and purpose.  Review the provided resources related to diverse co-teaching models (See attached Resources A B and C) as well as resources that have been provided to staff during TCICP professional learning days and are now in the resource bucket on the main office counter.      Review effective teacher language using Responsive Classroom resources located in my office or that you have received in the past.  Consider attending the Responsive Classroom Institute offered at the conclusion of this school year to refresh your understanding of effective teacher language.
1356247,2014,144198,2013-12-04 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation Cycle,COVIELLO ALISON,Please see below for the feedback in-brief with which I provided you at our post-observation conference held on December 18 2013:    Highlights    You talked aloud about your own thinking during the modeling portion of the mini-lesson.  You made explicit links between what you noticed in the text and what ideas you had as a result.  For example you said “Now I’m going to think about what this place feels like and the first thing that I’m thinking about is that she says that this New York City is crowded and everybody is in a hurry so that makes me think that this New York City seems like a really exciting place….so that makes me think that for this main character a change is taking place.”    The groups consistently referred to their book club folder in order to determine who was going to be reading recording and pausing the group for stop and jots.  You made many efforts to involve students who were not engaged in the work.  You spoke individually with Alisson several times during the independent work period.  You also read aloud to Clinton Makan and Raven in an effort to get them more involved with their books.    To Work On as You Move Forward    Overall you need to consider how you can maximize both the amount of time that students spend “doing” each day and the quality of the work that they do during this time.  This involves three key things: 1) Ensuring that that which you model and the directions that you give are very clear and cohesive; 2) Ensuring that the amount of time spent on transitions is reduced; and 3) Ensuring that your expectations for what children do during independent work time are very high.    •When you modeled for this lesson you did a nice job of verbalizing the reasoning behind your own thinking.  You said things like “I’m realizing that this takes place in New York City but it’s not present day New York City like you and I know and the way that I know that is because the…went to work in a wagon.”  When you modeled your writing about the text however you simply bulleted the details rather than the conclusions that this led you to.      •Although the class period was scheduled to begin at 9:42 the students did not enter your classroom until 9:49.  Half the class was seated on the rug at 9:52.  Here ten minutes was lost.  The students then spent 30 minutes on the rug.  You began to dismiss students to their seats at 10:19.  At 10:39 you rang the chime and told the class that they had two more minutes and should start talking to each other about what they had written down.    •You stated at the beginning of the mini-lesson “So we think about three things…We think about where is the setting what does this place feel like and then what changes might take place.”  You ended up modeling your thinking about where the story takes place and what that place might feel like.  Students were prompted during both the active engagement and independent work time to bullet point information related to where the story takes place and what the place might feel like.  You stated as you were modeling “So I used bullets to answer my questions. I just listed those details that I saw.”  Consider stretching this type of work so that students are building theories and consistently using evidence to support the theories that they come up with.  For example you could have students write in boxes and bullets short response form or flash draft form their big idea about how it might feel to live in a particular place at a particular time and the evidence they are using to support this idea.  You might have students gather details during the independent reading time as was done and then have them write off of these bullet points for 10 minutes at the conclusion of the period.    Consider your use of the take-a-break chair.  Clinton was sent there in the beginning (or perhaps opted to go there on his own) but it was not at all clear why he was sent or chose to go there.  While there he smiled quite a bit and made loud distracting noises with the window.  You ended up calling him out of the take-a-break chair as a result of the loud noises he was making.  You said to him “I think you should come back now.”  Because your students do not appear to be using the chair as a place to calm down or regain control but instead as a place to go and fool around please do not allow them to self-select into the chair any longer.  Consider changing the location of the chair when you institute this new rule so that perhaps the habit of playing around while in the chair will be disrupted.    Think ahead about vocabulary that students may not know but that will come up during the lesson.  Take time to either preview these words or phrases ahead of time or plan to pause briefly so that you can discuss the words more thoroughly at the time that they come up.  For example you told the students that you would be reading historical fiction at the beginning of the lesson however you discussed the genre only minimally.  You stated “Today we’re gonna start reading historical fiction and I’m so excited because historical fiction are books that were written about the past.”  Later as you discussed giving each book club a different book Moises said “I want to do non-fiction.  I like it.”  This comment indicates that Moises likely did not understand what the qualities of a historical fiction book are.  In addition when you read aloud the word Babushka came up.  Jayden and Henry were queried “Babushka?”  Providing students with vocabulary can serve to develop students’ background and content knowledge.

Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),CRUZ JESSICA,I have sent you a copy of Bloom's revised taxonomy for you to use as a tool for developing opportunities that promote higher forms of thinking.      I am also advising that you plan your conferences with students so they are purposeful and aligned to skills students need in order to become more sophisticated readers.  Your current lesson plan displays no evidence of your plans for conferencing.  Please submit one of your conferencing plans for next week so that I may review and provide feedback.

Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,What I would say is that this is a great opportunity for you to read the room and assess what methods students are gravitating toward.  This kind of data can help you determine how to move forward with small groups who to push with new ideas how to structure your assessments etc.  I noticed you were jotting notes on a post it.  I would recommend developing a systemic structure for documenting your conferences observations and note-taking so that it is both efficient and effective.  Please think about your current system and consider ways in which you can strengthen your data collection procedures.  Let me know by Tuesday January 21st what you have come up with.  I would recommend speaking with Mr. Fernandez or Ms. Maldonado on their system.  A great resource for this is also the text Driven By Data by Paul Bambrick-Santoy.  I have a copy if you're interested in borrowing it.  I am also including a sample tracker I have put together as a template you could use for any lesson where you are introducing multiple strategies to build the same skill set.  Tell me what you think and what modifications if any you would make to it.

1410341,2015,644237,2015-02-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You have created a caring classroom environment in which it is evident that the students take responsibility for themselves and each other.  There are clear structures and routines in place.  The predictability of these help students to function cohesively as a team.      You use language that is logical and measured.  This language offers students choices and opportunities to self-regulate their own behavior.     Students were aware of what they were working on and could explain the choices they made as writers.    Next Steps:    Work to find alternate ways to help struggling students identify details that connect to their thesis statements.  Asking questions with obvious answers does not give students the opportunity to think critically on their own.  For example with Eric you might restate his detail in an explanatory sentence such as "Warming up in gym gives us energy to learn in class because..." and then ask him to complete the sentence.  In this way he has the opportunity to think for himself either developing a sound argument or deciding on his own that this detail doesn't quite fit.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students were actively engaged in the work of self-reflecting and goal-setting.    You held discussions with students about the meaning of standards and the broad and intrinsic purpose of setting goals for oneself.    You took risks to try new more extensive ways to involve students in this difficult metacognitive work.    You used appropriate teacher language.    Students were able to self-monitor themselves using the take-a-break chair.    Next Steps:    Ensure that students have a clear understanding of what each standard means before asking them to self-evaluate and pick one as a goal.    Work to differentiate between other goals that students may have set during the school year in your class or other classes and current Research & Information goals.    Model for students how to specifically state why a particular standard is an important thing to do as a reader or writer rather than simply as a student.
1410341,2015,722171,2015-05-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You are consistently engaging students in the high level work of thinking about third grade standards through self-reflection and goal-setting and giving peers feedback.  You are taking time to explicitly teach students how to give meaningful feedback and why such feedback is important.  In this way you are over time developing students to be independent and critical thinkers rather than students who simply do something because they are told to do so by a teacher.  I commend you for taking risks to do such work and working hard to grow as you try out different methods.  I feel confident that the school will in turn grow and learn from your efforts as your experiences and findings are shared.    Next Steps:    Ensure that you develop a teaching point and lesson objective that aligns with your actual lesson.  By thinking carefully about exactly what you want to accomplish and why during a given lesson you can plan your overall lesson with much more specificity and purpose.    Be sure to organize materials well ahead of time in order to maximize student work time and minimize confusion and stress during instructional time.    Work on encouraging students to respond to each other during turn-and-talks rather than simply stating ideas.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your lesson plans evidence your detailed planning for your whole class mini-lesson.    Students were attentive to each other as group mates working together to make plans for their work and to create posters.      Next Steps:    When lesson planning for small groups or one-to-one work be sure that you have reviewed and analyzed student work in order to plan a focus for the adult working with the group or individual.  Providing adults with resources such as mini strategy charts from which to teach or simply key skills and strategies to notice whether or not students are using as a result of your work analysis is necessary.
1410341,2016,957241,2016-02-24 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,When Superintendent Alvarez and I visited your classroom we were impressed by the following:    All students were engaged in very rigorous work.    You were supporting learners with various charts around the room and at their tables.    Students were able to articulate exactly what they were doing.      Next Steps:    Find time after testing for students to go through their published work and reflect on the standards/teaching points that they have worked on during the course of the year.  While these do not need to be put into portfolios necessarily as I know that you want to have them handy in order to put them up for the SS Fair students should have a formalized time to look at their work as a whole with a reflective stance.
1410341,2016,968947,2016-04-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,I think it would be wonderful for you to share with the fourth grade team how you and Immediato have made intentional modifications to tasks and assessments while still maintaining a high cognitive demand.  Would you be willing to meet with Gomez and Reid and Quintero to share some of these learning opportuniteis and modified assessments?  I can schedule a meeting time for you to do this.  Please let me know if you and Michelle are open to the idea and I will facilitate the collaboration.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,POOLMAN BETHANY,During this lesson your students were happily engaged with the task of decorating their R&I notebooks.  It was a hands-on activity that helped them establish ownership of their notebooks as well as build excitement and anticipation of the learning to take place in your classroom this year.  Routines were clearly established in your class building a supportive culture that is safe respectful and focused on the task of learning.  However multiple students were not as clear about the why behind the activity -(the connection between the images they were choosing and the work they would be doing this year in R&I).  A suggestion would be to repeat the teaching point (decorating notebooks with images that relate directly to researching and non-fiction) during the independent work time.  Just as you were able to repeat explicitly about what to do with the glue sticks and the scissors you could reinforce the teaching point for students for whom the link still is not solid.

1415702,2014,125294,2013-11-26 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,Below are some points I want you to address during your planning of future lessons:    -Connection: use this opportunity to explicitly connect this lesson to previous ones and to the greater curriculum.  For instance in your current plan you wrote: "Ok guys here's a 10 frame how can we show 3 + 7?… How else can we show a sum of 10?" Instead your connection could be something like "Ok boys and girls today we're going to look at how making groups of ten when we add can help us add faster (or more fluently).  This will help us later when we are adding numbers larger than 10.  First let's review all the ways to make 10…"  You can use the "listen and draw" for this part.  This will allow you to quickly assess students' understanding of the "make 10 strategy".  (one of you can gather the data while the other engages students in the warm up or "engage" activity).    -Explicit Instruction: use this opportunity to explicitly model how the strategy will be used.  This is when students just watch what you do what you say what you think and what you write.  You may want to have your modeled steps already written up on a chart or pictorial steps displayed on the board.  After you model and right before guided practice you may consider asking students to tell you what they noticed you do (this is another opportunity for quick assessment.  You and Ms. Sieber  can use this data to determine small group work interventions reteach challenge tasks etc.)    -Guided Practice: Here you have your students trying it out with four problems (#3-6).  You can use this same amount of time by working through two problems using manipulatives and then having them turn to their partners and explain how the strategy helps them.      -Group Wrap Up:  This is currently blank.  Consider how you will use this share as an extension to the lesson.  The big idea here is to have your students talk about math explain their thinking share their understandings while you collect data to inform your next lesson.        -Differentiation: Currently your differentiation  lists five students and the task is "will need reteach R24 with counters to practice for understanding."  The question for me is how do you know they'll need the reteach before you teach the lesson?  Differentiation can be done in various forms:  pre-planned with targeted students: focus on lagging skills or a misunderstanding from a previous lesson that is common amongst the targeted students. Based on students' learning styles provide access to the lesson and the task in a modified way (use of manipulatives enlarged work space or print visual supports etc.)  pre-planned intervention/challenge strategies/tasks: here you have identified possible misconceptions generalizations struggles or opportunity for challenge.  You plan the differentiated strategies/tasks and then apply them to individual students based on the data gathered during the connection and the guided practice (or even that bridge between the explicit instruction and the guided practice should you have a bridge like the one described above).
1415702,2014,271181,2014-02-25 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the informal feedback I sent you via email on March 4 2013:    When I arrived you were teaching a reading mini-lesson.  Frog and Toad was being projected onto the board using the ELMO.  You also showed the handout on the ELMO.  This was a helpful way to engage students and get visual learners to better understand the work that was being done.     While working with a small group during the mini-lesson portion of the lesson you repeatedly pushed students to locate text evidence in order to support their ideas.  For example you asked "Oh now who can give me the evidence?"; "Who can give me the evidence for why Frog is a helpful character?"; and "Who can give me evidence for why Frog is a friendly character?"     You worked with a guided reading group during the independent work time.  Be sure to take notes during your small group work so that when you're planning for your next session with this group you can easily recall what you worked on what students struggled with etc. and then plan and instruct accordingly.      The handout that students worked on is a useful scaffold for both helping students to correctly identify characters' feelings and traits and reminding students to provide text evidence to support their ideas.  I would like to see you differentiate the amount of scaffolding you do however by creating templates that require more initiation and autonomous thinking on the part of the higher functioning students.  See me or Ms. Cruz if you'd like to talk through how such a template might look.  Finally your handouts should not be hand written.  Please ensure that all future handouts are typed.
1415702,2014,215936,2014-03-27 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,I enjoyed your lesson today.  The transitions were seamless all adults were being utilized efficiently and effectively making student to adult ratio an average of 6:1. That is awesome!   There were also a number of modifications and supports present for students based on their readiness levels (e.g. book clubs at students independent reading levels charts had either space for 2 pieces of evidence to support claims of patterns while others had more than three.  Furthermore some students had the patterns tracked by story on an additional chart for support with referencing textual evidence).  Here are two points for you to think deeper about regarding your professional growth and pedagogical practice and one detail to pay attention to:   -This is a major wondering for me.  How are you tracking individual students' level of understanding and mastery?  Think about what systems and structures you have for monitoring and tracking.  I know earlier in the year you and Ms. Sieber developed folders with index cards for each of your students.  However I am not seeing these used on a regular basis.  Your system needs to work for you and it needs to be consistently used because it is through the regular assessment of student learning and student outcomes that you can determine what your next pedagogical decision will be.  -Think about who is doing all of the work.  Currently it seems as though the teachers are leading the work and the students are complying with the tasks.  You need to shift your students' roles from being observers or responders to teacher-led questions most or 50% of the time to them being observers 20-25% of the time.  This will enable them to be active participants for the majority of the lesson allowing you greater opportunities to gather data on student learning and make informed instructional decisions and modifications.  -Overall your vocabulary and communication with students was clear appropriate and explicit which is why you were rated effective in component 3a.  However please pay close attention to your use of grammar; particularly in your teacher-made materials.  Your exit slip reads as follows: "Usually _________ is a ____________ character but his time they are acting ________.  They _______".  You are interchanging  pronouns by switching from singular to plural subjects.  Instead it should read as follows:  "Usually ________ is a ____________ character but his time he/she is acting ________.  He/She _______".

Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,When planning your read aloud please ensure you identify the purpose of the read aloud how you intend on making the purpose explicit to your students and how you will use your questioning and discussion techniques to engage them in rich deep thought-provoking discussions.     In addition I want you to consider the strategies you are using during your instruction.  Two strategies to facilitate this work and guide your students into thinking deeper about texts are:    1. model with a think aloud how to think about texts and use wonderings to help build predictions of texts.  2. make the texts more accessible to your whole class.  This can be done through the use of a big book of that text an Elmo so you can project it for the whole class and slowing down the pace so that students can really see the text and pictures in order to start building ideas.    In fact overall I suggest slowing down the pace of your lesson so that you can stop and model thinking as well as the strategy of stop and jots.  When planning your read alouds preview the text and identify places where you would like to stop and think and model how to grow ideas about the books we read.  You can write your questions and thoughts on post-its as a marker for yourself.  These strategies will help your students develop deep thoughts and ideas about text and will make your read alouds more focused and your teaching more intentional.
1418831,2014,123562,2013-12-02 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the email feedback you received immediately following this informal observation:     You handled the disruption with Alex seemlessly picking up the table that he tipped over and not making a huge deal of the disruption.  The students though some started to yell at him before you responded were generally unphased by the incident and did not pay much attention to him.     You circulated and assisted students with the assessment throughout the entire time that I was observing.  When students take an assessment make it a policy not toassist.  Instead strictly monitor behavior in order to keep students on task.  This will ensure that more students are working for longer periods of time.  At periodic time checks there were never more than 10 students actually working on the assigned task.  For example at 10:56 ten out of 19 students were working on the assessment. At 11:03 9 out of 19 students were working.  At 11:13 8 out of 19 students were working.     Try to use strategic movement breaks to help students regulate their natural need to move their bodies.  Perhaps just before starting an assessment or prolonged reading or writing period you could lead a movement break.  This may cut down on students' desires to run and jump during serious working times like these.     Students like Yamilka and Brayan should have sight word lists or rings with appropriate sight words for their current reading level (I can send you these if you need them).  They should be drilled daily (YMCA?).  Please see Ms. Grant for an idea of how to make the sight word rings.
1418831,2014,143627,2013-12-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,It took you a significant amount of time to get your students settled and in their seats.  Four students went to sharpen their pencils one was in the closet looking for something and Anna walked over to the doorway and stood there.  I heard you trying to be clear and explicit with your instructions and expectations (e.g. "this morning when I told you to get ready for the day I expected you to have at least three pencils sharpened and ready.  From now on in the morning you will need to make sure you have your materials ready otherwise you will have to sit and wait until I am done with the mini lesson to help you.")  Two ways to approach this issue (both very different) is to:    -Have baskets at each table with regular materials inclusive of sharpened pencils.  -In the mornings allot a small amount of time for student to sharpen their pencils and then put the sharpener away (out of sight out of mind).  In the afternoon take it out again for a brief amount of time and then put it away again.  In this way they will have to be sure they are ready.  You can always reinstate the sharpener as a permanent fixture but at the moment you want to ween them off of the distraction.      The flow of the lesson did not really adhere to the flow of the workshop model.  Most of the lesson was a guided practice or teacher model.  Therefore it became difficult to follow and identify which students could do it on their own and which were simply going through the motions and following along.  After looking at your lesson plan I noticed that the plan itself does not clearly explain the following areas which may contribute to the execution of your lesson:    -What you are teaching  -How you are teaching it  -How you are guiding your students through the practice  -What they will do on their own (the task)  -How you intend to assess their understanding misconceptions process  -Your modifications and differentiation for students (both struggling and advanced)  -Your lesson's closure & share    Please submit two of your math lesson plans for this week so that I can provide you with feedback on them.  Please send it to me electronically so that I can track changes.  We can then meet to discuss the lesson and implications for your planning on Thursday or Friday (let me know which works best for you)  I strongly feel if we tackle the lesson plan itself you may be better equipped to teach the lesson more effectively.      Aside from these two points I would like to point out that your efforts around communication and effective use of teacher language are well noted.  It is clear that your students respect you and you them.  The interactions amongst students and adults is one of trust and with minor modifications to the structures you have in place your class will run seamlessly.  It was a pleasure to sit in and listen to your students think about math.
1418831,2014,209374,2014-03-28 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,I enjoyed the mini lesson/read aloud I was able to observe.  I have two points for you to think deeper about:   -What revisions/revisits/modifications do you need to make to ensure that your students are actively and cognitively engaged during turn and talk?    -How are you monitoring and tracking student learning and student progress on an individual basis versus as the class as a whole?

Hyatt,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),CRUZ JESSICA,Based on your lesson plan submission it is evident that you and your grade colleagues have a collaborative relationship.  Your reading lesson plan is similar in nature to that of your colleagues.  It is great that you distribute the work amongst each other as a strategy for working smart; however please ensure that your lesson plan reflects the modifications you are making to the lesson for your class.
1418831,2015,520798,2014-10-20 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,
1418831,2015,590133,2014-11-25 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You consistently made efforts to stop the class and address disruptive or unfocused behaviors when you noticed them.    You rephrased students' comments about using a shortcut to figure out 20  14 to explain what was actually happening mathematically (2  14)  10.     When I spoke with Cheyenne and Dallas they were able to explain all of the work on the poster they had made for the Contexts for Learning unit in which the class was engaged.  They were both also able to explain the choices they made when revising the poster and their thinking around the peer feedback they had received.    Next Steps:    Be aware of your tone of voice and phrasing of questions.  Be careful not to give away answers with your tone of voice.    Steer clear of dichotomous questions as often as possible.    To more readily engage students consider seating them in a semi-circle while on the rug.  In addition provide more opportunities for students to turn and talk to each other in pairs thereby forcing more consistent thinking from a larger majority of students.    Work to engage students more during multiplication strings.  If you notice that the majority of students are not at all understanding the work that is happening during multiplication strings take time to do some explicit teaching in order to jump start the type of mental math skills you are working to develop.
1418831,2015,620333,2015-02-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,One thing to consider is the volume amongst teachers within the classroom.  While teaching with a parallel or station co-teaching model it is important that the volume within groups doesn't carry over to the other group so as to not become a distraction.  I recommend observing Ms. Tulloch and Mrs. Gomez during their execution of one of these co-teaching models so that you can observe how they manage the volume within the class at an optimal level for all groups.
1418831,2015,719366,2015-04-01 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You were working to push students to explain their thinking by asking "Why/" or "Tell me what you are realizing?"    You engaged two students in differentiated higher level work.    Next Steps:    Establish non-negotiable norms and routines for students and adults that you stick to at all times.    Work to establish genuine and thoughtful conversations that involve the majority of students.  See above suggestions.    Utilize time and adult-resources more purposefully.  Consider the amount of time you spend and structure that you use to review questions.
1418831,2016,858917,2015-12-02 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,
1418831,2016,923041,2016-01-13 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    All students in the room were nicely engaged.  You were utilizing the CY corps members extremely well.  It is clear that you prepared thorough plans for them to follow in order to ensure that the content was taught well.    With your group you were working to ask open-ended questions.    Love the accountability tracker!  Marly was able to explain to me exactly what it was for.    Kayla and Jake were super excited about the lesson once it was over.  When the students left the room they were telling each other how well the lesson went and how many of their students "got it."  Jake said to Kayla "Great lesson!"    I am so impressed with the huge change in your classroom from last year to this year!  The overall level of engagement is astronomical compared to last year.  Great job!    Next Steps:    Be very conscious of when you are asking yes/no or either/or questions where the answers are often given away by tone or are used to lead students.  On several occasions you began by asking an open-ended question and then very soon afterwards asked a more leading question thereby not giving the students an opportunity to think and wrestle with the work.    To develop situational or contextual understandings (e.g. that a bus is full and cannot fit any more people) illustrate the scenario and then let children play with it in pairs or independently or require them to illustrate/create the situation them selves.
1418831,2016,957302,2016-03-15 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Your lesson was very interactive and gave students real opportunities to explore.  Continue to develop these types of learning experiences in your classroom; they are a sure way to make math fun relatable and most importantly memorable.    Next Steps:  You need to make conscensious decisions about when to step back and let students productively struggle with the work (and ensure that the additional adults in the room are doing the same).  There is a great deal of teacher support and teacher questionning taking place which could result in many students not developing the level of independence they need for upper elementary and beyond.  One example was when Joshua was about to jump and stood in front of the tape rather than behind the tape as explained.  The adults in the room quickly corrected him; rather than asking students to check if Joshua was correct and elicit suggestions for how to help them.  In this way you capitalize on all the teachable moments and require students to be engaged in every aspect of the lesson.      There was evidence that students can push themselves and each other and it is this that I would like to see more of in your classroom:   Jason: So wait what were your numbers?  Johanny shows data from her paper and Djenab's pager  Johanny (to Jason): Do you have anyone with three siblings on yours?  We should put all of ours together on one sheet.  Djenab: I'll check to make sure each group of students were asked.    Johanny: Don't forget Angel.  Oh yeah and the teachers.    Consider the use of a timer to push you to keep on track with each section of your lesson so that students have ample time to engage in rich conversations about their findings at the end of the period.  In many ways this is where much of the learning may be uncovered or even developed and you shouldn't short change yourself or the students because you've run out of time.    Overall I am totally enjoying whatching how you are continuing to cultivate your practice and push your students toward becoming real mathematicians and not just math students. :-)
1418831,2016,1039121,2016-05-23 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You strategically began the lesson with the exit slip from the previous day.    You used open-ended prompts like "Anyone else want to respond or add on?" to encourage continued conversation during which participants build upon each others' ideas.  As a result students easily responded to classmates' thoughts.    Students demonstrated mathematical thinking that was logical and efficient rather than formulaic.    Students asked to demonstrate their expertise.    You took content-based outcome-focused observational notes.    Next Steps:    Teach students to ask each other questions that push classmates to explain their reasoning (e.g. What makes you say it is...?; How are you justifying your answer?; What's your reasoning?).    As the discussion facilitator you are making a clear effort to keep the conversation going and ask very open-ended questions (e.g. What do you notice?).  Now as the math content area teacher work on encouraging students to make their reasoning visible all the time by prompting with questions like: What's your reasoning?; How do you know?; Could it be...  Why or why not?; What is your justification for this solution?; etc.    Consider using small white boards during whole group work as a means to keep more students engaged and on task and to quickly assess students' levels of understanding.  You can observe Ms. Gabbard do this.
1418831,2017,1095512,2016-11-03 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You linked the academic vocabulary and skills that students use in Literature & Art and Research & Information to the work that mathematicians do.    You have begun to cultivate a classroom community in which more and more students are comfortable taking intellectual risks.    You managed student behavior effectively.    You encouraged more ideas to be shared by opening the discussion up to other thoughts when you said things like "Could there be any other thoughts floating around?"    You encouraged students to listen to each other's ideas.    You pushed students to explain their ideas.    You used a visual tool to remind students to understand the problem before solving it.    Next Steps:    When planning your lessons consider the big idea you seek for students to uncover.  Then plan and shape your questions carefully ahead of time so that you are actually setting up opportunities for students to uncover this big idea themselves.  Please email me one lesson plan which you develop with this goal in mind between 11/21 and 12/2 so that I can review it and provide you with feedback.    There was very little to no co-teaching taking place.  Please be sure that both you and Michele are utilized to your fullest during all lessons.  Additionally the lesson plan does not indicate Michele's role at all.  Be sure that the two of you are sharing lesson plans with each other well in advance of the scheduled lesson.    Ensure that all lesson plans are fully aligned with the stated outcome goals.  Please email me one lesson plan which you develop with this goal in mind between 11/21 and 12/2 so that I can review it and provide you with feedback. This should be the same lesson plan that you send me for questioning.
1436272,2014,250336,2014-04-07 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),COVIELLO ALISON,Below please find the immediate feedback that I sent you via email on April 7 2014:    You worked hard to create a calm orderly learning environment.  The stations were set up and organized ahead of time.  You went over the rules for the freeze tag game multiple times.  You demonstrated and talked through each of the seven stations.  You demanded quiet and calm every time that students sat saying things like "Raise your hand if you can tell me how you get back in the game" "Brayan please stop talking" "Sit criss cross applesauce."     You worked hard to develop a space where children respect one another.  You asked the students what you say to someone if you bump into them during the freeze tag game.  They all replied with "Sorry."  While demonstrating the stations you demonstrated how to give the next person in line a high five.  You showed this during your demonstration of every station.     You worked hard to integrate key vocabulary such as opposite into the lesson.  You also worked to explain to students what they were doing and the purpose behind the activities.  For example you asked the group "Can someone raise their hand and tell me what a tag game like this does?"  King answered "Cardiovascular endurance."  You replied "Cardiovascular endurance.  Great job.  Can someone tell me what that is?  What muscle does it strengthen?"  Students replied in unison: "Your heart."  You then went on to explain that they were also working on changing directions quickly dodging etc.     The stations were varied and included movements with different parts of the body.  Students got to practice going backwards on a scooter kicking a soccer ball throwing a ball bowling balancing a bean bag on their heads while walking dribbling a basketball and jumping rope.     Mr. Maisonet (para) was seated on the bench.  His one-to-one child was absent.  There were also three students seated on the bench during stations.  Think about how you can strategically use Mr. M. to help with the management of these seated students.  For example you can ask him to sit next to one of them or in between two.  Alternately think about strategically placing Mr. M. during the station work.  He can stand at one side and help students in one or two stations.  He does not need to do any cardiovascular work but he can supervise.  Another idea would be to have him do some sort of flashcard physical education vocabulary work with students who are sitting out...  The big idea here is that he is a human resource.  Consider how you can best use him at all times.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights    Students were asked to practice and knew very well the content-based vocabulary to name parts of the body.    The class was well-managed throughout the observed period.  Students knew the routines well and followed them easily.  A respectful tone permeated the class.    Next Step:    Take time to explicitly introduce what you are teaching or the class is doing each day and why at the start of each day's lesson.  In addition name the unit for students (i.e. Basketball Skills).  During and/or at the end of the lesson engage students in thought about how practicing the skills they practiced will be helpful to them when they play a game of basketball (i.e. The ball won't get away from us because we'll know how to dribble with our fingertips.).
1436272,2015,644266,2015-03-03 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Although this was only Class 3-202's second physical education class this school year it was evident that the students were very familiar with the routines and structures as a result of their physical education experiences the year prior.  Routines are explicit and consistent.    Instructional coherence and content consistency was evident from one grade to the next.      Next Steps:    Work to find times that you can offer students choices.  The choices however should act as opportunities for students to self-reflect on their strengths and weaknesses and deliberately consider how they can improve their skills.  Over the course of a unit push students' independence and meta-cognitive thinking by repeatedly asking them to reflect on which skills they have mastered and which they are working on and what they are doing to work towards improvement.    Develop questions that promote student self-reflection/assessment and more holistic thinking about the unit and skills.    We held a pre-observation conference on March 2 2015.  During this conference we discussed the class context.  You explained that the observed period would only be your second session with Class 3-202 given the new spring semester specialty schedule.  For this reason you explained that you might not get through all that you planned because you might have to take time to reinforce the routines.  We discussed the need to be explicit with your directions and purpose as a result of the feedback you received following your first observation this school year.  We also discussed assessment and thought critically about what types of assessments are most and least useful to your instruction.    We held a post-observation conference on March 6 2015 during which you reflected on the lesson and considered highlights and next steps.

Next Steps:    Be mindful of lesson pacing and dedicate the majority of the class time to unit-specific content.    Provide students with visual supports that define vocabulary (with pictures and text) and highlight strategies.

It is evident you are consciously building student vocabulary and language and working to help them understand purpose.  In this lesson (as well as every other lesson I have observed of you) you have worked to make the connection between the sport they are engaging in and its health benefits.  You are also deliberate with the experiences and exposure you're providing students with thereby expanding their awareness of types of sports fitness and even nutritional choices.    It is also evident based on your immediate feedback to students and your redirection that you are actively observing students in play and addressing any immediate misconceptions or inaccuracies.      Next steps:   Consider how you are tracking student progress/development.  Your current rubric doesn't seem to be a tool that accurately reflects or represents what you are actually observing and providing feedback on.  If you choose to continue using a rubric as your assessment tool you should align the feedback and your observations to the rubric.  You will also need to flesh out the rubric so that there is a clear and distinctive progression from level to level.      Another possibility is to use a checklist instead outlining your expectations behaviors techniques strategies and/or skills for the game you are engaging students in.  You can then quickly check off whether you observe them demonstrating ability or not.  Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.  Also once you decide how you will proceed with your progress monitoring tool please share with me and I'll provide feedback if or as needed.

We met for a post-observation conference on April 4 2016.    Highlights:    Your written plan and enacted lesson demonstrate your content knowledge.    You were attentive to students' needs and assisted them seamlessly when necessary.    There are clear routines in place in your classroom.  These routines prevent off-task behaviors.      Next Steps:    Align all parts of your lesson with your stated lesson objectives.  Draw explicit links throughout the lesson to the big ideas or content you want children to know and understand.

They moved quickly during the warm-up from each activity/stretch to the next.  They were engaged and happy to be participating in gym and it is clear that you have established a culture focused on physical activity.  Moving forward add times to your plans so that you have a realistic sense of what can be accomplished in one 45 minute class period.  There were multiple activities listed in your lesson plan that did not seem to happen during this class.  Two students also had to visit the nurse from accidents that resulted during this period.  While natural enthusiasm and excitement can be hard to reign in consider building in a quick routine safety check to ensure that shoes are tied no one is chewing gum etc.  This may prevent some small injuries and it gives you a moment to emphasize safety in your classroom.  You may also want to use markings on the end lines to help students move in straight directions while going from one end of the gym to the other thereby trying to prevent diagonal crossing.  (i.e.- “Tavado you run from this blue dot to that blue dot and Cesar you run from this green dot to that green dot…”)    Your “Forehand Tennis Swing Checklist” is a great first step towards assessment.  To take it to the next level involve the students in accessing this list. Create posters to continually reference with the whole class or give individual copies to students.  Give them access and encourage them to make assessments building their knowledge and awareness of these skills.

Students were calm and respectful to you and each other.    There were clear routines in place for moving about the classroom and students knew these routines well.    Next Steps:    When planning be sure that: 1) you are very clear on the purpose of the lesson and write a teaching point that reflects this purpose and 2) you write out exactly what you will say for the entire modeling/think aloud portion of the lesson.    Ensure that the modeling that you do for students clearly and explicitly demonstrates the teaching point you wish to make.  Think: What do I want students to learn?  What is the purpose of teaching this?  What result do I hope to see as a result of this teaching?    Get in the habit of analyzing student work to "look for" whether or not students understood the day's teaching point.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    During the reading workshop students were grouped into book clubs and matched with appropriate leveled texts.    During the reading workshop all adults were engaged in small group or individualized instruction.    Next Steps:    It is an absolute necessity that all charts and other printed materials that you and Ms. Gomez create are grammatically correct.    You must explicitly model all teaching points.  Refrain from asking students closed questions during your mini-lesson as the method of teaching a skill strategy or craft.    Please ensure that you develop your knowledge of Responsive Classroom practices before September 2015.    Please ensure that you are using the P.S. 154 K - 2 daily reading log (See USB received at the beginning of the year).  This reading log tracks student volume and stamina.  Th reading log that students were using on the day of the observation doesn't track either.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You made your thinking explicit when modeling how to solve near doubles addition problems.    The energizer was a great way to give students a quick break and provide a short amount of time to be physically active.     Next Steps:    Plan all lessons using your knowledge of student understandings and analysis of prior student work.  This will help ensure that your instruction is targeted to students' exact needs.    Your lessons should begin with a connection to earlier work done (usually the day before) and a statement about what they will learn today and why.  Then move right into the modeling.    Carefully plan your management moves.    Always make sure that you are speaking loudly enough for students to hear you while still maintaining a calm tone.    Work to limit your use of questions at the start of a lesson (this should be the modeling portion (or I teach) portion.  If using questions at the start of the lesson you must alter your lesson on the spot if students' understandings do not match your plan.    Utilize the share portion of the lesson as an opportunity to teach.    Please continue to submit your lesson plans to Ms. Cruz on a weekly basis for review and feedback.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,As discussed please continue to submit your weekly reading lesson plans for feedback as well as your monthly unit plans for all subjects so that I may provide you with feedback to ensure you are challenging your students' thinking promoting independence and building your practice.
1446504,2016,922968,2016-01-28 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,We met for a pre-observation conference on January 27 2016.  We met for a post-observation conference on February 1 2016.    Highlights:    You spoke calmly and respectfully to students throughout the observed period.    Next Steps:    Align all aspects of your lesson plan.  Ensure that the purpose and how of the teaching point makes sense for all students.     Take note of student disengagement or students' lack of understanding of the teaching point and readjust the teaching and learning accordingly.    Set clear standards for student interactions with and treatment of one another.
1446504,2016,970155,2016-04-13 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,It was good to see you implementing the Cookshop program during this lesson.  Preparing the egg in vinegar solution overnight so students could see the impact acid has on the egg was a great plan and an excellent opportunity to bring the science into your classroom.  Remember Bookshop is meant to expose them to healthy eating habits and choices but should not be a stand alone program.  In the future you need to think about how to truly integrate your Bookshop lessons with the other disciplines in a more strategic manner.  When connecting it to science which this lessons so easily lent itself to students need to engage more in the scientific method participating in the experiment documenting their observations and data collection making hypothesis and checking their hypothesis.      Next Steps:  Plan out your next Cookshop explore lesson fully integrating science into it.  Consider each of the steps in the scientific method and plan out the activity so that students are fully engaging in the work and not just observing you do the work.  Think about the purpose of your lesson (what exactly do you want students to understand about protein and how does this exploration/experiment help them understand it?)  Draft the lesson and send it to me for feedback.  This lesson should be implemented the week of May9th.  Also write out the types of questions you will be asking to ensure that you are increasing the level of complexity in your questioning.  Use the Bloom's Taxonomy as a tool to help you craft your questions.  I will send you a copy of the Taxonomy for your reference.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:      You worked to push River who is currently reading well above grade level to begin writing about his reading on post-it notes.     Next Steps:    You must be an active part of the teaching at all times.  This requires a level of co-planning of all lessons.  If co-planning cannot always occur in-person ensure that you have reviewed all lesson plans ahead of time and reworked them to best match the needs of your students.  You must be utilized as a human resource at all times.  For this lesson you could duet teach modeling together the goals you are each setting and strategies you will use to reach your goals parallel teach or station teach (students could rotate to two different stations - at the first they could work with one teacher to set an appropriate goal; at the second students could brainstorm the strategies they might use to reach reading goals).  Or if the lesson is going to be in the "One Teach One Observe" model you could take on the informal assessment work noting what students are and are not understanding.  The bottom line is that you must demand that you are a part of the lesson planning process.  No one person should be assigned to "teach" a particular subject.  While one person can be in charge of the initial planning for each subject you are both responsible for teaching all subjects and therefore you must both know and be a part of the planning process.      Actively monitor for student understanding and alter instruction when necessary.

1462878,2015,729130,2015-03-31 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your lesson plan is detailed and aligned.  You thought carefully about what you would say while modeling and which examples you would use.  You planned for meaningful differentiation.    There are clear routines in place in your classroom.  You repeatedly spoke to students in a calm tone.    Students spent lots of time with text.  Students moved seamlessly from one reading activity to another.  Students were highly engaged with text throughout the reader's workshop.      Next Steps:    Work on varying your language when managing student behavior.  Work on not always asking questions to remind students of routines and expectations but more typically providing clear simple direct and calm instructions.    Work to minimize questions that have just one right answer or are answered with yes or no.  Work on developing more genuine discussion when appropriate by using a well-placed and planned open-ended question.    Think ahead and notice what materials are or might be distractors for students while reading.  Remember at this stage that you want to encourage as much independent reading time as possible.  Therefore eliminate post-its when possible.      Pre-Observation Conference: We met for a pre-observation conference on March 27 2015.  In addition to discussing the planned lesson you discussed your current work on both taking note when students are not understanding a particular concept or skill and being flexible during a lesson when you notice that students are not understanding or there is a misconception.  You also discussed your practice of taking reading and writing lesson plans from your colleagues as frames but actually engaging in your own detailed lesson planning in order to best meet the needs of your particular students.  Finally we discussed working to anticipate while planning which students may need something different or supplementary to the whole class mini-lesson.    Post-Observation Conference:  We met for a post-observation conference on April 2 2015.  During this conference you reflected on the lesson noting that the message of the mini-lesson was clear especially with the poster that showed the two clues.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students were incredibly engaged and independent in your classroom.    You have solid routines in place.  You utilize effective teacher language and maintain a calm tone.  Your own exuberance for learning (and of course for teaching) is palpable and evident in students' actions and the purpose with which they attend to their own work.    You expertly thought out loud about your own moves as a writer.    Next Steps:    Always plan the exact pages or excerpts you will use during the modeling and active engagement portions of your lesson plans.
1462878,2016,956871,2016-03-09 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your questioning was consistently open-ended and the student engagement in the discussion evidenced risk-taking and critical thinking.    You supported students with your tone words mathematical modeling on the board and differentiated independent work.    You are a constant learner eager to both share your own practice and learn from others.      Next Steps:    Make a plan to regularly hold inter-visitations with Ms. Gabbard.  It would be phenomenal if the two of you could closely study the types of questions that you ask and responses that you give students thinking about how these two work together to create such intellectually engaged student environments in both of your classrooms.  If you two are willing I would love for you to plan a presentation for the staff for a May Monday.
1462878,2016,1028066,2016-04-11 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You explicitly modeled what to do in each poetry center.    You encouraged student risk-taking and class collaboration with your non-judgmental responses to students.     You engaged students in a collaborative rule-making process just for poetry centers.    You were clear firm and quick with your directions for student behavior.    Students took risk to ask their own questions (e.g. "What's plump?") and you responded not by giving the expert answer yourself but instead by turning the question back to the class to answer thus encouraging and expecting the students to serve as resources for one another.     You modeled excitement for the work ahead.     You encouraged continuous intellectual engagement.    You checked for student engagement throughout the modeling portion of the lesson.    Next Steps:    Consider how you can track what students do in each center using what you notice them already doing to consider the make-up and content of small instructional groups for the rest of the unit.
1462878,2017,1100914,2016-10-18 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Student behavior was entirely appropriate throughout the observed period.    You demonstrated genuine care and respect for students namely George as you worked to keep them focused and engaged.    You were extremely animated and engaging as a reader during the read aloud session.  Students easily turned back towards you following the turn and talks as you jumped right back into the reading.    Next Step:    Ensure that your read aloud plans always include questions or prompts that relate to common core learning standards and are varied in terms of reading engagement activities.
1463478,2015,526586,2014-11-05 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You had a calm tone and demeanor throughout the observed lesson.    Next Steps:    Thoroughly plan the mini-lesson portion of your lesson thinking carefully ahead of time about what students need to know and understand in order to be successful during the independent work period.  When planning consider exactly what you will say and do and what supports students will need during your model (e.g. charts elmo copies of text etc.).    Plan an active engagement that involves all students and enables them all to practice the work they will do during the independent work period.    Minimize the amount of time that children spend on the carpet in one sitting.  Ten - fifteen minutes at a time is the maximum amount of time Kindergarteners should spend on the carpet at one time.    Consider how you and Tiffany can make the transitioning of small groups more seamless and less disruptive.    Explicitly model for students the skill or strategy you expect them to do during the independent work period.    Check for student understanding prior to the independent work period.  This can often happen during the active engagement portion of the mini-lesson.  Listen in to partnerships as they discuss their plans.  You can also ask students to quickly name one thing they will do when they return to their seats (e.g. label the rips on my leaf drawing; add a sentence about the color of my leaf etc.).
1463478,2015,653172,2015-02-06 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    All of the learning activities were aligned in both your written lesson plan and the enacted lesson.    Your classroom atmosphere is calm caring and respectful.    There are clear routines in place that allow learning to continue at all times and minimize down time.    Next Steps:    Ensure that the modeling portion of your mini-lesson is planned with specificity.  Know which text and portions of the text you will use.  Ensure that the sections you choose to model with are good examples for the strategy you are working to teach.  Additionally be deliberate about what you will say and do throughout the entire modeling portion of the lesson.    Keep shared lists of questions and noticings on which you list the most thought-provoking and rigorous ideas and questions.  In this way you can promote more critical nuanced student thinking.    Consider how to check for all students' understanding of each day's teaching point.    Pre-Observation Conference: Held on February 5 2015  Post-Observation Conference: Held on March 23 2015

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlight:    All elements of the workshop are aligned to the teaching point in your written lesson plan.    Students had tools in their red reading folders and knew exactly what the tools were.    You worked to monitor student understanding with a checklist.    Next Steps:    Develop your written lesson plans so that they include more specificity and intentional thought about what pages and sections will be best to demonstrate particular strategies.    Ensure that the share portion of your lesson is purposeful and planned.  It should be teaching and learning time for all students.  Be aware of student engagement during the share time.    Send students home with more than one book each night.  Work to let them choose at least one of the books that goes home.
1463478,2016,867403,2015-12-09 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You consistently demonstrate genuine care and respect for all of your students.    Your lesson plan reflects the beginnings of the workshop model structure.    Next Steps:    1) Ensure that you thoroughly plan for all lessons.  The modeling portion of your mini-lesson should always be planned in detail.  It is recommended that you script this part of your plan.    2)  Interactively model with students how to respond to the chime when it rings one time.  Then with consistency ring the chime one time raise your hand and wait to speak until all students are focused on you and the room is entirely quiet.     3) Throughout the course of a lesson monitor student understanding.  When necessary react accordingly changing your plans on the spot to address glaring misconceptions.    Please submit two writing lesson plans for the week of January 19th to me by Friday January 15th.  I will provide you with lesson plan feedback.  My feedback will focus on the explicitness of your modeling the alignment between your modeling the active engagement and the independent work; and on the misconceptions you note as possibilities to look out for during the lesson.    I will return to your classroom to informally observe you (non-Advance) during the week of January 19th.  During this observation I will provide you feedback on your use of the chime the explicitness of your mini-lesson and your monitoring of student understanding.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You tried out parallel teaching with Ms. Lee for the first time on this date.    You were consistent with your expectations for behavior thereby resulting in a focused class as a whole.    You tone was calm throughout the observed period.    Next Steps:    Ensure that you explicitly model the teaching point using clear language and charts.  Rehearse your mini-lessons ahead of time to ensure that what you actually do matches your lesson plans.  If you do not fully understand the teaching point be sure to check in with Ms. Mazzeo ahead of time to gain clarity on the skill strategy or concept.  A deep understanding of the teaching point is likely to result in a clearer execution of it when you teach it to the students.    To grow and develop professionally you must make every effort to deeply understand both the content of what you are teaching and the pedagogical skills necessary to execute well.  Please work with Ms. Mazzeo on a weekly basis beginning next week (Week of April 4 2016) to observe her teach.  Decide (with Ms. Mazzeo) the day of the week and time that you will visit her each week and let me know what you decide by this Friday April 1 2016.  I will then work to free you at this time each week.  You should always observe her teach a mini-lesson.  In addition set aside at least one period a week to discuss the content of all mini-lessons with Ms. Mazzeo.  Let me know what period you and Ms. Mazzeo decide to work together each week by this Friday April 1 2016.
1463478,2016,970917,2016-03-31 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,It was a pleasure being in your classroom.  It was clear all students were working on their all about books and feel comfortable in your room as they work.      It was also great to see how you are already beginning to establish the skills of researching at such an early level of learning.  This was evident when you shared Enrique's work and told the class he is using a book on dinosaurs to get ideas for how to draw his diagrams. :-)    Next Steps:  -Develop a system that is comfortable for you to track student learning/progress.  I recommend meeting with Minji to discuss this.  She uses a graphic organizer with her groups that seems to be simple to use and effective for gathering data and monitoring student progress.  I'd like to see what you come up with or choose to use for your future lessons.  Please share with me before we go on break the tool you plan to implement into your lessons for tracking student progress.    -Be more specific about what students are doing in their groups.  It is unclear why they are grouped the way they are and how their learning experience is matching their current level of readiness.  Your plans only describe who will be in which group but don't explain what the task for that group will be; which leaves the assumption all groups are doing the same thing.  Given your vast learners and learning styles this should not be the case.  Whatever modifications or differentiation being made for each group; whether it is a modification of the task the time or the resources should be more clearly explained in your plans.
1463478,2016,990292,2016-05-05 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You were explicit with your own modeling.    You utilized the Elmo to model your own reading work for students.    You and Ms. Lee planned and engaged in the duet teaching model.    You worked to engage students in personal goal-setting.      Next Steps:    Use engaging songs to get students focused and ready.  Minimize the amount of movement or loud talk you need to do.    Continue to engage students in self-assessment and personal goal-setting.  Keep the following things in mind when doing this work: 1) Ensure that students have the prerequisite knowledge to be able to engage meaningfully with the presented task; 2) When goal-setting think about which students would benefit from having fewer strategies (or powers) to choose from or which strategies (or powers) are appropriate goals for particular students (e.g. students at Level C will have different goals or powers that they are focusing on than students at Level E) and differentiate their goal-setting sheets accordingly.

It speaks to the skills and strategies of the current unit as well as to the consistent work you and your students are doing on reading stamina volume and habits.    Students were engaged in high level work around thinking about conflict in historical fiction texts.  Students' writing about reading demonstrated their ability to support their ideas with evidence from the text.    Students were reading historical fiction texts on their reading levels.    You were actively meeting with students in one-to-one conferences and tracking the work done and conversations had during these meetings.    Next Steps:    For students for whom the heading "My Thinking" is simply too broad scaffold for them by providing high level guiding questions.  The aim should be for all students to do high level thinking one way or another.

As a first year teacher you are doing a phenomenal job.  Your attention to detail in your plans and in your execution are noted and highly commended.  Your dedication to your students and your colleagues (staying late for parent meetings pulling small groups beyond class instruction time working after school academic clubs and coaching the basket ball team alongside Coach Sotsky) are reflective of the high quality teachers the students of P.S. 154 are blessed to have.  We are grateful to have you on our team. :-)

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    All four adults working in the classroom were working with small groups of students.    Students were thoroughly aware of exactly what they were working on and could name the strategies they were using.    Next Steps:    Ensure that text complexity matches students' reading levels.    Ensure that question stems are common core aligned.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Your written lesson plan and enacted lesson demonstrated your knowledge of high quality literary essays.    You provided a supportive mini-chart to students who were struggling to develop basic thesis statements.    You combined your knowledge of individual students and your own high expectations for student success to manage student behavior and provide students with opportunities to self-regulate.    Next Steps:    Work to push students to develop more sophisticated thesis statements.    Work to analyze student work either by yourself or with Devin to develop small group work plans that more purposefully individualize instruction for Devin's focus group students.
1467188,2016,876141,2015-12-22 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,During our post-conference we discussed your facilitation of discussions and your questioning.  It was noted that opportunities to explain their thinking (or choices) wasn't consistent during the turn and talk and therefore became unclear whether students were being strategic with their word choices to describe the atmosphere of the story or whether they were just choosing words from the list provided.  I am recommending you plan out your questions to incorporate opportunities for students to justify their thinking and to continue to elevate the cognitive demand of your discussion opportunities.  I recommend using Bloom's Taxonomy to help you formulate your questions so there is progression in the complexity of your questions which will ultimately contribute to a rich discussion amongst students versus a share out of ideas. Please use this tool as you plan your questions for next week's lessons and let's meet on Friday the 29th to discuss whether there was a change in the level of discourse and participation amongst your students; particularly in class 401.  I would recommend tracking the responses of the following students; Edward Olivya Kaitlyn Angel Madison Daniel and Naron as these were students identified in your small group conference sheets as having difficulty pulling details relating to setting and having difficulty inferring the emotional setting.    Lastly I was very impressed with your incorporation of more complex vocabulary such as the word atmosphere to describe setting.  As discussed in our post-conference please be sure to be intentional with the use of new vocabulary.  The average student (person) needs to hear something 4-7 times to begin to internalize it; a student (person) with special needs needs to hear it 10 times that amount which means they need to be exposed to the new language 40-70 times.  That being said make sure you are consistently redirecting them or connecting the new language to the work they are doing.  In other words in this case every time you ask them to describe the physical and emotional setting remind them they are identifying and describing the atmosphere of the story.  Follow up by providing opportunities for them to use the new language in discussion - make this the expectation so that students are building their new vocabulary; not just being exposed to new vocabulary.

1467188,2016,1029293,2016-04-21 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Overall your lesson reflected an expectation of deep critical thinking of text that is aligned to the standards for this grade.  In our post conference you shared you have determined students are coming into fourth grade with little awareness of story mapping; something you expected they would have been exposed to prior.  This was something you also noticed last year; which is why you included the story mountain model in this unit.  That is very smart thinking of you and shows you are constantly reflecting on ways to make your lessons more accessible to students while still maintaining the cognitive demand.  You also shared a desire to meet with third grade to see how and where we can integrate story mountains in third grade so that students coming up to you in fourth aren't completely unfamiliar with this concept.  I would like to schedule some time for you and Ms. Maldonado and Mr. Fernandez to meet (perhaps during our chancellor's planning day) to find ways to align some of your units and align skills across grades while building on the ladder of progression grade by grade.       Next Steps:     On multiple occasions during this lesson students demonstrated they rely on you to determine what their next steps are.  Because you spend a significant potion of your lesson working with individual students or small groups (which is excellent) it seems students need a system that fosters building independence.  This could be in the manner of them checking and self-assessing their own work prior to moving on to the next task (rather than waiting for you) or it could be a list of tasks they could work on while waiting for Mr. Anthony or you to assess their progress.  One suggestion is to create a checklist for students to review and assess their work.  Your checklist should reflect both conventions as well as content that is aligned to your learning target.  For example in this lesson you could use the guiding questions sheet to develop the content-based criteria of the checklist.  Another approach is to focus on tasks to complete while waiting for teacher assistance (e.g. reflecting on your reading in a reading journal reading independently reviewing vocabulary by creating an alphabet matrix with visuals correcting paragraphs with pre-determined errors etc.) I'd love to see what possible ideas you have around this checklist or the list of learning tasks.  If you'd like to brainstorm some ideas for this list of activities let me know and we can schedule time to put this together.
1467188,2017,1086848,2016-11-03 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,POOLMAN BETHANY,You designed an aligned and well-thought out lesson helping your students think about how to create a thesis statement that is valid and can be supported with multiple points of evidence.  The checklist was a clear tool that students were able to pick up and make their own after shared practice of using it on the rug.  Your routines and management were excellent demonstrated by the absence of any misbehaviors.  How can you take the strong foundation that you have established in your classroom to push your students to be even more independent and critical thinkers?  What structures can you put in place so that they are beginning to question themselves before you prompt them?  How can you encourage everyone to engage in intellectual risks and not just to those that it comes naturally?
1480879,2015,579692,2015-01-08 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,It was a pleasure meeting with you to discuss your observation and my noticings and feedback.  To recap here are some additional bullet points from our discussion.    -Take some time to review your classroom environment.  Make strategic choices about which process charts you could and should have up to support your students' learning.  Remember process charts should be clear bold legible and accessible to your students.  You can refer to the SmartCharts book Dr. Coviello gave you when you first stated with us.  You can also visit Ms. Mazzeo Ms. Dabe or Ms. Reynolds' room (338) for ideas on this.  Remember your room should tell a story of what learning is occurring in your classroom.  Student work should be posted around the room with feedback from you.    -Ensure that your flow of the day is actually a flow of the day's teaching points instead of simply your day's schedule.  In this way students and staff are familiar and aware of the expected outcomes for the day.    -Email me your teaching points for next week's lessons so that I can review them and provide suggestions on how to develop engaging learning activities that will align to your instructional outcome and excite your students through the process.  Please send them to me before Monday January  26th.

Students responded to your directives with ease.    There are some effective routines in place in your classroom namely the chime and echoed clapping.    Next Steps:    You must plan for every subject every day.  At no time is a lack of planning acceptable.    You must model every skill or strategy at the start of your lesson.  Going forward please ensure that all lessons follow this structure: There must be a mini-lesson during which you explicitly model the teaching point.  There must be an active engagement during which students have a scaffolded opportunity while still on the rug to practice what you just taught.  Next students should have an opportunity to practice the skill either independently or in a small group.  When adults are working with small groups they should know exactly what to do with that particular group or individual.  Accordingly your plans must be present clear and shared with them.    Organize materials ahead of time in order to reduce the amount of lost time.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You are developing a stronger working knowledge of how to execute a guided reading group.    Next Steps:    Ensure that you plan your guided reading group book introductions in writing.  Plan exactly what you will say.  Have your plans in front of you while running the group.      Determine a teaching point for the guided reading session using your notes and your knowledge of the level (Resource: Reading Habits Skills and Strategies A - Z - main office counter).    Prompt students with familiar strategies rather than telling them unknown words.    Refrain from talking about students in front of them.    Give short simple directives in order to reduce student confusion and increase positive student behavioral responses.
1480879,2016,859237,2015-11-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    Students were working in small groups.  All adults in your room were being utilized as teaching resources.    You are providing social emotional supports for your students.    You are modeling care and respect with your own actions and words.    Next Steps:    Follow the Recipe for Reading prescribed plan for all students.  To assist you with this work please begin submitting Recipe for Reading lesson plans and the accompanying resources that you will use(e.g. writing paper and copies of sound cards) to me for review each Friday afternoon.  Plans should be comprehensive for the week ahead for all students in your class.  Please begin submitting lesson plans to me for review and feedback this Friday January 9th and continue submissions on a weekly basis for the next 4 weeks.  I will come in to informally observe you teaching a Recipe for Reading lesson during the week of January 18th and we will meet to discuss your progress with Recipe for Reading lessons during the week of January 25th.    Remain consistent with the routines and structures you put in place in your classroom.    Maintain a consistently firm yet caring stance with all students.
1480879,2016,968510,2016-03-08 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,This lesson reflected a great deal of growth in your practice.  You should be very proud.  There was a seamless flow of work throughout the four stations in your room.  Your work with your small group reflected very deliberate thinking and effective strategies and speak to how well you know your students. :-)    Next Steps:  As discussed your lesson plan should reflect what you actually intend on teaching.  It is meant to be a guide and support for you (or anyone coming into your room to work with your students).  We talked about creating a section in your reading lesson where you outline your small group work.  Here you can identify the focus of your word work; the activity and the students being pulled.  In this way your plan is relfective of what is actually happening and you aren't writing lessons for the sake of writing lessons but not related to what you are actually doing.  Please send me a sample of one of your lesson plans in the coming week so that I can review and provide feedback as needed.    Keep up the good work!
1480879,2016,1028016,2016-04-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,We met for a pre-observation conference on April 11 2016.  We met for a post-observation conference on April 22 2016.    Highlights:    Your reinforcing and reminding statements during the guided reading lesson demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of early literacy development.    You have systems in place in your classroom that encourage student independence.    The adults in your classroom work seamlessly to support student success.    Students are aware of the structures and routines in place in the classroom.    You worked to encourage student thinking by posing an inferential question.    Next Steps:    Introduce the lesson explicitly at the start of the lesson by telling what why and how.  Tell what the teaching point is why it is important and how (or what strategy) the teaching point will be accomplished.    Restate the strategy you are teaching in its entirety at strategic points during the mini-lesson.  For example when transitioning to the active engagement you can restate the strategy by saying something like "Now we're going to read The Jigaree.  When we are done we will retell the story by stating the title the pattern and the ending."    Utilize well-designed supports and specific referral to the strategy throughout the lesson to support more students' independent engagement with the strategy (See examples given in Component 3c).

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    All interactions between adults and students in your class demonstrated care and respect.    Student behavior was appropriate throughout the observed period.  There were clear routines and expectations for behavior in place.    You had planned thoroughly for the group and were working to engage all of them in rigorous work.    Next Steps:    As per our post-observation conference and my follow-up emails sent on November 1st and November 4th please continue teaching the 1st grade reading units of study to your students who are reading at Levels K and below and the third grade reading units of study for your other readers.    Ensure that you are focusing largely on reading volume and stamina as well as guided reading with your Level K and below readers.    Please utilize the research from Allington to guide the number of books that students in your class are reading each week.      Utilize the reading goal-setting sheet with Level K and below readers prior to independent reading each day (sent to you via email on November 4th).  Utilize the P.S.154 book logs with your other readers prior to independent reading each day.

1485140,2015,672251,2015-03-25 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    During your lesson you worked to expose students to the criteria by which they would be graded on the NYSESLAT.  It is important for them to have exposure to this information.     You tried to engage students using technology.    Next Steps:     You must plan a separate lesson for each group that you service on a daily basis.  Lessons must include: The lesson's objective(s) teaching point explicit modeling an active engagement an opportunity for students to work independently a share and a plan for assessing student understanding.  All components of the lesson must be aligned to the objective(s) and teaching point.     Every lesson must have a clear teaching point that you actually model for students.  The rest of the lesson must align with this teaching point and provide opportunities for students to practice the skill or strategy either in small groups pairs or individually.    Ensure that the lessons you plan are developmentally appropriate for students' ages and second language acquisition.    Support:    Please submit one lesson plan to me for review and feedback each Friday by the close of business (an electronic version is preferred).  The lesson plan should be for a lesson that you intend to teach the upcoming week.  I will review the plan and provide you with feedback by that Sunday.  The plan should include your objective(s) and teaching point the modeling portion of your mini-lesson the active engagement the independent work the share and how you plan to check for student understanding.    You have been assigned a temporary mentor Ms. Khan.  You may schedule mutually agreeable appointments with her to review your lesson plans.  When Mrs. Greene returns from maternity leave she will take over as your mentor.

Be mindful however that this does not constitute a full lesson or a coherent teaching point.    Next Steps:    You must learn the content.  I have seen little evidence this year that you understand early literacy concepts or ESL strategies.    Your lesson planning must be specific and coherent demonstrating a clear teaching point that is aligned to an appropriate common core learning standard and accurately reflects the needs of the children you service.    Your lesson plans must demonstrate thoughtful planning about the skill strategy or content you are teaching the standards your teaching point matches and how you will coherently teach the teaching point.
1485140,2016,802717,2015-10-15 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Highlights:    You engaged students in a modified Morning Meeting to start the session allowing them to build rapport with each other and yourself.    Next Steps:    1.  You must begin to explicitly model skills and strategies.  Prior to Thanksgiving I will arrange for you and I to visit a classroom together to observe a teacher teaching the mini-lesson.    2.  Your lesson plans must be thorough and explicitly planned out.  Planning the exact questions you will ask as well as the modeling portion of every lesson in detail will help you to execute a productive lesson.    3.  Work to use very specific language when you speak to your students.  This is important when working with all children but especially with the beginning English language learners with whom you were working during this session.    4.  Ensure that all parts of your lesson align with the unit's intended goals.
1485140,2016,898227,2016-01-12 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,CRUZ JESSICA,Overall it seems what is lacking in your planning and practice is a clear purpose for your lessons.  When developing a learning plan one needs to think about WHAT they are teaching WHY this concept/skill/strategy is important and HOW they will get the learning across.  In this case the HOW is not effective because the WHAT and WHY are unclear.    As you plan your lessons I want you to consider what idea/concept/skill/strategy you are teaching and why this learning is important for your individual students.  Once this is clear you will need to identify where your students are developmentally and what they can do on their own so you can develop a clear and effective HOW for your lesson.    Next Steps:    -Submit two lesson plans each week for the next three weeks for review.  In your plans please include the following:   ---The WHAT and the WHY in your objective so that I may be clear as to where you are planning to go with your lesson.    ---A clear description of your model  ---A clear description of what your students' will be doing during their active engagement and their independent practice.    ---the tool you plan on using to monitor student learning.  I am recommending you start with a checklist that identifies each of the strategies/skills/knowledge your students need to be successful in the learning task.   Please submit this tool along with your plan for review.    Each of these plans should be submitted to me no later than Sunday of each week before you plan on teaching them.
1485140,2016,963337,2016-03-10 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,Although I was scheduled to formally observe you on this date during this period the observation had to be cut short due to the fact that a soft lockdown had to be called during the latter half of the period during which I was observing you.    We met for a pre-observation conference on March 9 2016.    Highlights:    You provided vocabulary support for the class both visually and kinesthetically.    You worked to keep students focused.      Next Steps:    Be constantly mindful of the way that you use your time to support the English Language Learners in the classroom.  Pay attention at all times to their level of focus and individual needs.  Consider reasons why student focus might be lacking (e.g. lack of understanding distraction) and make deliberate moves to ameliorate these problems.    Address student concerns that relate to student safety with care and attentiveness.    Always know the end goals of all units in which you are a participating teacher.
1485140,2016,1003718,2016-04-22 00:00:00.000,07X154,P.S. 154 Jonathan D. Hyatt,7,Formal Observation,COVIELLO ALISON,We met for a pre-observation conference on April 18 2016.  We met for a post-observation conference at 9:00 a.m. on the day we returned from spring break May 2 2016.    Highlights:    You prepared pictures of gardens to share with students supporting charts and mini-charts and a text with large font for Mia.    Next Steps:    Utilize Common Core Learning Standards TCRWP's reading and writing progressions and the NYSESLAT rubric to determine appropriate teaching points and strategies for students at various grade levels and reading levels.    Prepare supporting materials that are developmentally appropriate and grammatically correct.    Provide background knowledge and vocabulary at the start of the lesson if the content is needed to access the teaching point.    Explicitly model the what and how.      Provide students with opportunities to practice together before sending them off to work independently.     You have attended a Responsive Classroom Institute.  Review RC language patterns and logical consequences. Practice proactive management rather than acting reactively.    Actively assess and analyze student work products during and after class taking note both of what students are able to do and their areas of struggle.

Hyatt,8,Informal Observation,POOLMAN BETHANY,During this lesson you worked with some ELL students in 3-204 in different capacities to support their learning during Research & Information.  Initially you gave one-on-one support to Kevin in the hallway practicing sight words before moving to the rug with Danishka and Jayden and finally working with Jayden Danishka and Misael on finding supporting details in the hallway during independent work time.  You were clearly prepared for the work with Kevin and the small group work on main idea and details with accompanying word cards posters and worksheets at the ready.  Pushing in can be incredibly challenging but you demonstrated the organizational skills and preparation to handle these varied tasks.  Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:  Have a “to go” bag/tote/bin with basic items that you may need in any room including pencils writing boards markers extra paper etc.  This way no matter where you are you will always have the basic items your students may need.      Try to avoid using your time as merely an assistant.  That is don’t sit on the rug while a teacher gives a mini-lesson to your students.  Maximize every minute of your push-in support by continuing to work with individual students or small groups during this time.      This class has 8 ELL students.  Based on their various needs you will probably not work with all 8 every single time you push-in.  However over time how can you keep track of who you have supported in what specific ways?  Can you keep create a note-sheet or google tracker so that you have evidence over time of which students have been working on which skills and who has demonstrated mastery?

Next Steps:    One of the most challenging areas we are working on as a school is 3(b) in the Danielson Rubric.Take the opportunity to review the information that will support moving our students in a series of questions and prompts to challenge students cognitively advance high-level thinking and discourse.

Providing more examples of point of view in nonfiction texts would better guide students through the magazine activity. Perhaps putting it on the other side of the graphic organizer would be helpful.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

The time and taught put into your planning and preparation is evident through the rich classroom discussions.     I realize that you have turned in several artifacts to be evaluated and I will check with Ms. Berner to determine if other artifacts will be needed.

They have clearly learned a lot about Evidence in Argument this year and have read researched practiced and now revised their debate.  The tools you provided them helped organize and articulate their evidence to support their side of the debate.  I was very impressed with the tools you used and their effectiveness in getting students to write their notes in order to present a well planned debate. You also managed the other adults in the room in a very professional manner as everyone played an important role in supporting student work with no distractions.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!

How do you integrate deep knowledge of the students' strengths IEP goals instructional levels interests and needs into the lesson and unit plans to provide rigorous learning experiences?    How are the questions you ask specific guiding and open-ended as appropriate in order to scaffold students 'critical thinking?    Thank You

You have supported them both academically and socially teaching them everyday living skills.    Some questions to think about.    How do you identify instructional outcomes that are Common Core aligned and as appropriate include career development and occupational standards vocational skills and functional learning outcomes?    Thank you
0343494,2015,534245,2014-11-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,This small Special Education class was very interesting.  The 3 groups were grouped effectively and were working well the paras were working in conjunction with the teacher and the Learning Target was being discussed.  The do now handout helped the students relate to the LT in a personal way and provided a quick assessment sheet for the teacher.  The foldable activity helped the students learn the material in another way and allowed for multiple entry points for the Big Idea.    Wonderings:    How do you allow for the variety of learning styles in a written assessment for a unit?      Thank you for allowing me to learn in your room.

It is evident how much you care about the quality of education your students receive each day. Some questions to think about.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?  In what ways did the use of questioning successfully support students mastery of the objective? How do you know?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0343494,2015,682574,2015-04-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Jones-Walker  I enjoyed your lesson with 801 as they worked in their literary circles to analyze the poem Harlem by Langston Hughes and begin their exploration of the American Dream and the reading of A Raisin in the Sun.  Students read the poem and discussed their interpretations while another group looked at the figurative language and literal interpretation to help explain its meaning.  These were high level thinking questions and you provided vocabulary with definitions so that students could more easily decode the poem.  Students then shared their ideas with the whole class.  One students said the poem was about what happens when "a dream withers away."  You segued the discussion into the book A Raisin in the Sun since the name of the play came from one of the lines in the poem.  Students then had to predict what they thought the play may be about.  Next Steps:  From your lesson plan I can see that this is going to be a really exciting unit!  I really enjoyed the lesson and all I would add would be you reading the poem aloud once so that they could hear you say the words and think about them as they read along.  Hearing you may help them process it.  Even though it was on the screen some students may want a copy to annotate.  Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0343494,2015,755732,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Jones Walker  It was a pleasure to visit your ELA class with 702.  You have been reading and studying the issues in the novel the Outsiders and today your class was listing and discussing teens problems in the book and current teen problems.  Students had created journals with entries and handouts pertaining to the book.  You provided a graphic organizer to help students do this work and students worked collaborately in their literacy circles.  You managed and coached each group with the help of paras who were also engaged in the work.  Students generated lists of problems that were relevant to the text and to today's teens.  All were engaged in these conversations.  Next Steps:  In the end students will address the critical thinking question "Are there ways to face or avoid these problems?"  It was the last question on their handout and a very high level thinking question.  After discussing their ideas consider having them write a journal entry on proposed solutions to these teen problems.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students' reading and writing lives!
0343494,2016,832379,2015-12-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Lateshia    I enjoyed visiting your classroom today; you have established wonderful relationships with your students and classroom paraprofessional your lesson  was engaging and your Unit Plan: Settlement of America is both thorough and thoughtful (e.g. "bookmark pages on laptops to assist with students who are below the reading passage level").    If you review the Danielson continuum to move from "Effective" to "Highly Effective" in the areas  of"Questioning and discussion techniques" and "Using assessment in instruction" the difference is teacher directed vs. student directed- for example "students initiate higher order thinking" and "students have helped establish evaluation criteria." If either of these are areas that you would like to focus on I'd be happy to support you with them.    I look forward to observing your classroom again.      Sincerely    Marcy

I also thank you for walking me through the scaffolding you put in place to ensure all of your students success. The level of work you have engaged your students in is amazing.     How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students?Why?  What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
0343494,2016,978786,2016-04-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Jones-Walker    This Grade 7 12:1:1 Social Studies class was discussing the primary and how it fits into the election process when I entered the room.  The students have been working with the Big Idea:  Understanding the election process.  You had created a great visual path to election that was hung on the board.  The students then moved into pairs to continue the research that they had started using computers and carefully selected web sites.  The students were discussion the topics and the candidates ideas.  The paraprofessionals were working with groups and you moved to each group to work with the students.  When a student tried to explain a viewpoint by saying "...doesn't respect her..." you refocused the student and stated"..that doesn't really tell the story...you can find more...explain the reason..."  The student then went back to the article for more information.  When the class shared out some students prefer not speak aloud and you allowed others to read aloud his/her opinion.  You then gently asked the silent student a few questions to elicit a response from that student.  The atmosphere that has been created in the room is one of warmth and respect which in turn allows each student to strive to work to his/her potential.  This class was wonderful and you allowed each student to express a viewpoint in a judgement free zone while still being required to explain the reasons with evidence.  You also asked questions about the date of the evidence and if items found in the past would change a student's opinion when weighed against recent items.  In the fall this would be a great lesson to share at a PD.  It would be useful to all of the Social Studies teachers to see your approach to evaluating candidates and opinions in a judgement free room.   Thank you so much for allowing me to see this wonderful lesson.

Next steps:    As an overall goal for the school we will continue to develop the questioning and discussion techniques. Using a variety of prompts and questions to challenge students cognitively and advance high-level thinking and discourse.     Also another great technique would be to have the students review the grading rubric after answering a question give themselves a level grade.     We will continue to met and discuss different strategies. Thank you

Below are some questions to think about as we move forward.     How are the questions you ask specific guiding and open-ended as appropriate in order to scaffold students/ critical thinking?    How do you ensure that students have the opportunity to respond in a variety of ways?    Thank you.
0397392,2014,479663,2014-06-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for June 3.2014.    I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the dedicated work you have done this year as the SETTS teacher. Your students were given great support in their learning experience      Thank you
0397392,2015,600553,2014-11-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Valentin      Thank you for the opportunity to visit with you and your students. You have rerally demonstrated how much you know and understand where your students are educationally. They continue to benefit greatly form your instruction.     Mr. G. Stanislaus
0397392,2015,683977,2015-04-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,When I entered the room the 6 Grade 8 students were working together with the teacher to review math topics chosen by the students.  The teacher was demonstrating how to solve a student selected problem with the students instructing him on each step ("walk me through").  The student's asked many questions and were willing and able to provide answers to each other.      Mr. Valentin    Thank you for inviting me into your class today.  It was wonderful watching the students work as a team to solve the problems that they had selected.  You incorporated a vocabulary lesson note taking skills using calculator functions as well as working out the selected problems with the students.  The lesson was well planned and differentiated for the students to meet the needs of the students in the room.  This lesson was a wonderful example of a successful SETSS grouping.
0397392,2015,726154,2015-05-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Valentin    Thank you for the opportunity to visit with your students. Your students seem really excited to be part of your program. With so many different students at so many different levels of learning how do you organize the materials and resources to be appropriate to the learning needs of the students?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0397392,2015,769687,2015-06-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Valentin    Thank you for the opportunity to engage in instructional conversation. Your students and peers greatly benefit from your dedication to your work on behalf of your students. have a great summer.    Thank you    Mr. Stanislaus
0397392,2016,862569,2015-12-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Valentin    The students that you were working with were completing blogs for the ELA class.  You created scaffolded graphic organizers based on each child's learning style and helped them to learn to use the tools to create a individual product.  You incorporated the evidence in argument rubric as a method for the child to self assess the blog for accuracy and completeness.  The students worked together to make corrections and edit.  The assignment was making ELA and Science connections as well as teaching a new computer skill.  When this assignment was completed you moved on to math and based on a prior assessment you created a leveled worksheet to teach the students the concept.    This lesson was a model for scaffolding and differentiation.    Thank you.
0397392,2016,945187,2016-03-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Valentin  It was a pleasure to visit class 611 while you were teaching/pushing into their math lesson and servicing your SETSS students.  You assessed the needs of your students as they worked on their do-now and taught several students at their tables until they could work on their own.  You spent a bit longer with one student as she was absent the day before and needed a quick catch up lesson.  By mid-lesson she was on her own and teaching others at her table.  You used a variety of methods and tools for supporting your students including manipulatives calculators and sketches to help students understand the concept of finding surface area of prisms and pyramids.  Your checklist of standards made clear the expectations allowed students to self-assess and provided important information for you and your coteacher for future planning.  The open-stations worked beautifully as students worked at their own pace independently and collaboratively while challenging themselves to complete and move on to harder problems.  Some students checked the board for guidance while others asked for help from teachers and peers as the grouping of students was a strategic support.  The conversations were rich and on task and students were working successfully.  Wonderings:  I noticed a few students working without graph paper.  Please let me know if you need these resources as they may be particularly important during this unit.    This was a really great lesson.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0397392,2016,991115,2016-05-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,

Although I needed a translator to understand the lesson I did not need a translator to sense the excellent rapport you have with your students!  When you returned the test many students were unhappy with their score.  However using this student data you decided to reteach the content that most students did not master and provided an opportunity for students to improve their score with a re-write of problem number 4 for extra credit.    Wonderings:  Students could have used more time to work together to improve their writing and less time reteaching.  Perhaps you could have grouped students intentionally (high achievers with lower) to expedite the work and be able to conference with each group.  I look forward to seeing a lesson and activity on new material that will engage students in the reading writing and speaking of French via discussions inquiry and new work products.    Thank you for your dedication to your students.
0448483,2015,606464,2015-01-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,This was a Social Studies class taught in French.  When I arrived the students were reviewing prior work with the teacher.  The students then moved to a homework review and working in groups on new material.  I was in a group of 5 students (who needed to translate for me) and I asked how many were "native speakers" (3 were anglo phones).    I was wondering:  When you create the groups do you balance the two groups.  The students in my group deferred the writing part to a francophone because they felt that that student would "do it better".   While this Social Studies class is basically in the same unit as the non-dual language grade 7 classes have you made the connection to the triangular trade in the colonies (Americas)?  Please continue to make connections to the Americas and move forward to the Revolution in the colonies as soon as possible.  Thank you for your work in this program.
0448483,2015,634263,2015-03-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Fleuriot-Bertin  It was a pleasure to see your 704 students working on La Nouvelle France and early American explorers in FDL social studies class.  In your lesson you wanted students to share their individual research on the explorers and create a chart that would gather their findings in groups of four.  You gave them a chart template which included the name of the explorer the date of discovery and the area they explored.  You provided reading and research links in the previous lesson.  Wonderings:  To increase the rigor of this activity you might consider students discussing their findings in groups (with carefully planned questions) debating the importance of each explorer and/or moving on to the bigger concepts of exploration and their impact on the native American and colonization instead of just preparing the facts. These students will be much more engaged in critical thinking than in reviewing facts.  Thank you for your dedication to your students.
0448483,2015,770742,2015-06-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Flueriot-Bertin    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. You have been able to buid a great sense of confidence in your students. Their confidence is evidenced by their willingness to contribute to the lesson at hand. Think about the following questions as you move forward in your lesson planning.    What criteria is used for assessing the students work?  How do the students use the assessment criteria to check their work?  How do you ask high quality questions that cause students to think and /or reflect and deepen their understanding?  Thank you and have a great summer!    Mr. Stanislaus
0448483,2016,823508,2015-11-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Fleuriot Bertin    I was impressed with your students' active engagement- so many wanted to share their answers in response to your questions. I was equally impressed with your students' ability to understand the social studies content in the French language without needing clarifications in English.    You have established a wonderful rapport with your students and I look forward to coming in again.    Marcy
0448483,2016,872667,2016-01-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,When I entered the room the students were already doing presentations.  The language of this class is French so the students I sat with helped translate for me.  The students were paying attention to the classmates who were presenting and taking notes.  After the presentation the students reviewed the notes and assessed the classmates.  The students were able to support his/her claim with evidence from documents.  The students always spoke in French and did not need to have any clarification in English.    This was a well though out project.
0448483,2016,924161,2016-03-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Bertin-Fleuriot  It was a pleasure to visit your French second-language lesson with class 704.  Students were completing a quick warm up in their text books which forecasted the day's activity.  They were reviewing a dialogue about buying a tie as they were getting ready to create their own dialgue about buying an article of clothing.  You reviewed the book's example asking students to read it out loud.  You then asked students to write their own dialogue using the book example as a model but choosing your own article of clothing to purchase.  Without any questions students began working with their partners to create their own unique dialogue between store clerk and customer.  Next Steps:  Consider using a quick check list or rubric to define the details of what is needed in the dialogue for example note the length required vocabulary tense etc.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

The first week of December we will discuss best practices in questioning and discussion techniques. I will set up a meeting next week. Welcome to MS 51.     Mr. Stanislaus.
0526263,2015,579673,2015-01-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Josh  It was a pleasure to watch you teach math to class 702.  They were highly engaged in discussion and problem solving with their work-partners throughout the entire lesson.  Students tackled the 'proportion markup' problems which required applying prior knowledge with each question.  Students used the help of adults and partners to work through the problem solving under a tight time schedule.  This lesson was almost identical to what I was seeing in general education math classes the same morning which speaks to the level of rigor you are providing your students.  Wonderings:  Would additional resources (manipulatives books technology) help your students visualize these real world problems?  Create a wish list - not sure if I can make it happen but will try!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0526263,2015,745316,2015-05-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Krupitsky    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Truly you are doing an amazing job with your paraprofessionals and students. The following are a few questions to think about.     How do you use classroom discussion among your students? Why?  How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0526263,2015,742870,2015-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Krupitsky    Thank you so much for allowing me into your grade 6 S.E. Math class.  I was amazed by the work that was being accomplished and how the students took responsibility for helping each other.  The grouping was working very well and the interaction between you and the class para was seamless.  This was a model of how instruction should work.    Please invite others into your room I know that they can learn from the model that you have set up.
0526263,2016,843125,2015-12-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Krupitsky  This class was wonderful to observe.  The students were anxious to explain what they were learning and both the paraprofessional and you were moving quickly from group to group in order to assess and correct for misunderstanding.  The students who have alternate assessment were working on a curriculum that was tailored to the individual need of the student and both were able to get immediate feedback from the program.  You make the students accountable for his/her own learning and they assess the progress of the group daily.    Thank you for the opportunity to see a great Special Education/fully differentiated lesson.
0526263,2016,872656,2016-01-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Krupitsky    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class it was a pleasure. You and your paraprofessionals have really established a positive learning environment for all of your students. It is clear that the programs you are using continue to inform you of the needs of each of your students. Below review the questions to think about as we move forward.     How do your students use the assessment criteria to check their work?  How do the students know the assessment criteria?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
0526263,2016,877271,2016-01-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Krupitsky  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade math class as they worked on solving multi-step word problems.  Students worked in partnerships reading to one another thinking-aloud together and assisting in problem-solving in a collaborative manner based on your cooperative partnership rubric.  All students' written work was extremely neat and organized a testiment to your teaching how to approach these word problems.  Your high expectations in class was also evident as students were all engaged in the work even when they struggled they struggled calmly with focus and persistence and in the end they were productive.  They didn't give up.  You and your para visited each group and you adjusted the lesson when you assessed the level of readiness of your students for the next set of problems.   Next Steps:  Please let me know how we can better support your students with new resources supplemental books or software. Please continue to lead staff in learning more about MasteryConnect and using data to plan instruction.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0576516,2017,1081342,2016-11-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Ehue  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade ELA writing lesson.  Students were beginning to construct topic sentences for their literary essay.  In the lesson you talked about possible topic sentences based on the theme of the short story Thank You Ma'am.  Students seemed a bit confused about writing the topic sentence based on the examples you were showing on your chart.  As noted in the exit slips which you provided many students wrote that they were confused about summarizing the story and connecting the theme based on the lesson.  Next Steps:  Consider taking a more inquiry-based approach by showing them a model literary essay based on a different text so that they can unpack what a high quality topic sentence looks like in the context of a paragraph and essay.  Students are engaged and learn best when they can analyze and notice model writing and then 'try it' on their own piece.  The topic sentence should not only agree with the theme they are writing about but also announce to the reader how the paragraph will support the thesis.  Your approach was confusing because the examples you were using were summarizing the story more than announcing or connecting the theme. Students had to "imagine" or "theorize" how a topic sentence of each paragraph might look instead of using a writing mentor text as a model as they begin to draft.  Please continue to plan coherent curriculum with your 7th grade team with the guidance of our coach Ms. Schwartz.  She can support you with workshop lesson ideas and model texts used throughout the grade.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

Students were engaged in various types of games and sports on the field and basketball courts.  Students were given a choice of activities and managing their own behavior based on the structures rules and protocols you have established with your class.  Thank you for providing this unique opportunity to your students on such a nice day to be outside.

Growth:    Moving forward there are several things we will work on together.    1. The importance of using questioning and discussion techniques in a way that creates a genuine discussion among students providing adequate time for students to respond and stepping aside when appropriate. Before your next informal observation we will meet to discuss.  2. Before your next observation we will meet with your co-teacher to review the lesson plans and modifications. These lessons should demonstrate the teacher's plans and practice reflecting familiarity with a wide range of effective pedagogical approaches in the subject.     During the week of Jan. 6th 2014 I will set up a meeting for us.    Thank You.

The areas of focus will be 3b. Questioning and discussion techniques.     below are some question you could think about as you plan your lesson.    How are the questions you ask specific guiding and open-ended as appropriate in order to scaffold students' critical thinking?      Using Questioning to Develop Understanding  View resource @ teachingchannel.org  https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/questioning-in-the-classroom     Thank you    How do you ensure that all students have access to questions and discussion?

I will let you know when i will be visiting your class again. I look forward to you leading the class and your co teacher supporting you during that lesson.     Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus
0658657,2015,714837,2015-05-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Hogan  It was a pleasure to watch your students working in your and Mr. Caron's math class.  You had modified a handout/rubric for the Math Survey Project and helped students check off what they had accomplished already and pace the work so that it will be done on time.  Students had already completed more than half the project.  They were also working on a vocabulary exercise that would result in a quiz on Monday.  You brought student to the library and were helping students organize their vocabulary words that had already defined teaching them to create study cards and using study skills.  Next Steps:  Whenever possible consider staying in the room (or close proximity) with your small groups to save time and make yourself more available to the rest of the students who may need your expertise.  Thank you for your dedication to your students!
0658657,2015,740096,2015-05-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Hogan    The students were working to finalize and complete the survey project.  You were working with a few students who as part of the ICT or SE push in students needed a great deal of extra attention.  You helped them organize to work (taking out the necessary items and organizing the folders) and answer the questions step by step.  You refocused students and redirected them to complete the task that had been started.    Next Steps:    Please move to other struggling students if time allows.  Co-teaching is challenging but your skills working with the students one on one are valued.
0658657,2015,770783,2015-06-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Hogan    Thank you allowing me to visit your classroom. You are a dedicated teacher to all of your students. As an ICT teacher it is imperitive that both teachers work on developing the best working relationship. This year we have met together with your co teacher in Math and we will continue to support the both of you in building that professional relationship.    We will continue to help you actively engage with your co teachers in professional conversations. thank you for your commitment to all of your students.    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0658657,2016,796003,2015-10-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,As discussed you have structures set up in the classroom to support student learning. One thing to consider is to use scaffolded instruction/activities and have the paraprofessional that is assisting the class circulate the classroom (similarly to you) instead of staying with one group the entire time.
0658657,2016,864515,2016-01-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Hogan  It was a pleasure to visit your math class with 604 as they worked on Ratio Table Problems.  Students were working on the first problem.  Using the projector you all reviewed the solution together completing the ratio table.  You then asked which students wanted to work on problem #2 on their own hands at 3 tables were raised but it wasn't clear how the students who did not raise their hands should be working.    It also wasn't clear how you were checking for understanding.  None of your questions ever asked students to explain how or why- you only asks about step-by-step operations or which number had to fit in the boxes of the graph.  You also didn't ask if they had any questions about the how the problem was solved.  When you selected Bryce to share his answer (even though many students had not finished the problem) he showed the wrong process but received no feedback.  The next student shared the correct solution but there was no discussion about which was right or wrong and who might explain to Bryce where he made his mistake.  This would have helped Bryce and the others who may have made the same mistake or were confused.  I wasn't sure if everyone understood problem #2.  Next Steps:  1) Ask students to explain why.  We want students to articulate their thinking and problem solving decisions aloud to really push their thinking.  They will have to explain in writing on their tests.  2) Check for understanding.  Ask for a show of hands for who needs more time peek over their shoulders for correct solutions and processes to share ask for 'thumbs up' if they understand etc.  Choose an excellent student with the correct solution to share with the class.  This can help reteach the concept.  The girl who presented the right solution could have helped address Bryce's questions - this was a missed opportunity.  3) Ask students if they need more time so that the pacing of the lesson allows for problem solving discussion asking questions productive struggle and collaboration.    Thank you for considering these lesson adjustments.  I appreciate your work in these efforts to help your students learn.
0658657,2016,900339,2016-02-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Hogan    I enjoyed observing you co-teach 6th grade math with Ms. Lippolis.     The co-teaching model that you and Ms. Lippolis used "One Teach One Assist" did not allow me  to observe and rate two of the instructional components. While this model is an option for co-teachingit does not always create a powerful instructional partnership to most effectively support all students including students with disabilities. If interested I would be happy to meet to discuss other models with you (and/or Ms. Lippolis).    We have had previous conversations about students with disabilities finding their strengths and providing positive supports/reinforcements so they can succeed academically.Toward the end of the observation I asked if Damiya needed to show her work so Ms. Lippolis came over looked at her worksheet and said that yes she needed to. Then you came over and said out loud that Damiya used the calculator because she "Can't do the math without it." Damiya was embarrassed and Ms. Lippolis said "Yes she can do it".  When you walked away I asked her to show me how to do one of the problems without the calculator and she did. Based on that I would recommend that you continue to focus on promoting students' achievement of grade level standards and IEP goals with a belief that they can meet or exceed them.

Why is it important for students to be engaged in self-assessment and peer assessment?  Why is it important to form questions and assessments that help diagnose evidence of learning?  Why would it be beneficial for students to engage in discussions with the teacher stepping out of the central role into a mediating role?    Please feel free to meet with me so that we can continue this conversation and together look at ways to implement the next steps.
0721577,2014,21787,2013-09-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,It is evident that you have been able to establish an environment of learning and respect. The students are aware of your expectations of them the classroom procedures are well understood.     Next Steps: Through this year we as a department will continue to focus on improving our questioning and discussion strategies. Remember questions of high quality cause students to think and reflect.And when students engage in discussions they are able to explain and justify their reasoning and conclusions based on specific evidence.Take this opportunity to review 3(b) of the Danielson 2013 Rubric on questioning.
0721577,2014,281343,2014-03-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,As one of our most veteran teachers you have established an environment of respect and rapport and a culture for learning.     We are constantly looking for ways to engage our students on different levels. Moving forward we should meet to discuss ways that we can assist the students in engaging at a highly effective level.(All students are intellectually engaged in complex thinking.   I will review the artifacts you gave to me and let you know if others are needed to complete this years evaluation.   Stop by my office any time to discuss.
0721577,2014,336412,2014-05-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,You have established an environment of respect and rapport.    Over the next two informal observations we will take a closer look at 3b. Questioning and Discussion Techniques.     Take a look at the site   Using Questioning to Develop Understanding  View resource @ teachingchannel.org  https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/questioning-in-the-classroom     Thank you.

Below you will find some questions to think about as we move forward into another year.     How are the questions you ask specific guiding and open ended as appropriate in order to scaffold students' critical thinking?    How do you ensure that students have the opportunity to respond in a variety of ways?    How do you use augmentative and alternate communication systems to support students in responding when appropriate?    Thank you
0721577,2014,479690,2014-06-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for June 4 2014.    I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for the level of commitment you have demonstrated to your students.     Thank you
0721577,2015,624006,2015-02-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Greenblatt.     Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class.  I look forward to visiting your class again and seeing:     How you ask questions that make students think and reflect on deepening their understanding?  What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?    Thank you.    Mr. G Stanislaus
0721577,2015,656522,2015-03-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Greenblatt  It was a pleasure to visit your Density Lab with 705.  Students worked in groups to observe the changes in a washcloth to model the changes in density of rock due to temperature.  Students worked together to follow the quick lab procedures and then discuss the questions to draw conclusions and answer the critical thinking questions.  Students were able to use prior knowledge to apply to the new scenario.  Students noted "cold is denser" "hot molecules spread" "the greater the density it sinks" "hot rock is less dense than cold rock."  You then went on to the lesson on mid ocean ridges.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!
0721577,2015,660027,2015-03-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Greenblatt    The lab on reversing poles was very interesting.  The students were working together to complete the "quick lab" in the allotted time.  The use of the count down clock helped the students to remain on task as they explored ideas.  The students were excited and tried to figure out spacing and as they figured out a problem (spacing etc.) they were helping other students who were facing the same problem.  When I left the room the groups were just about done with the experiment and the class was moving on to sharing the information that they had found.    Wondering:  How is the experiment assessed?    Thank you for including me in this lab.

You have demonstrated extreme organizational skills that keep parents in the loop of their child's educational experience. Thank you for your commitment and dedication. Moving forward think about    How you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?    Mr. G Stanislaus
0721577,2016,847223,2015-12-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Greenblatt    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. Students in your classes are confident that they will be able to cover the entire curriculum. As we move forward as a department we are looking forward to finding opportunities  for our students to experience science out side of the classroom. A few questions to think about  How do the activities and the assignments promote student thinking?  During the lesson how did the groupings of students improve the learning?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?  Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0721577,2016,892295,2016-02-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Greenblatt    Thank you for allowing me to visit your classroom.You have established an environment that makes it easy for students to concentrate on learning. Your lessons are well prepared and planned out in such a way that the entire curriculum is covered. please see a few question below.     How do you use materials and resources in a way that is appropriate to the learning needs of the students?  How do you decide your instructional groups?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
0721577,2016,951149,2016-03-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Greenblatt    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class Your students were greatly involved in the activity "The lab report Experiment".    What was the criteria for assessing the students work?  How do you know that all students met the learning outcomes?  What role does your co teacher play in sharing the lesson responsibilities?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
0721577,2016,1008117,2016-05-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Greenblatt  It was a pleasure to visit your science class with 704.  After a quick collection of homework and attendance tally students worked in teams to determine the speed of electromagnetic waves.  They used the lab handout as a guide reading and following the procedures using the stop watches rulers and flashlights to conduct the trials and then calculate the average speed of light.  You and your co-teacher visited each group asked questions and faciliated when needed.  During the share you used the projector to present the model data charts for all to see and review the questions and calculations.  You told the students that there would be time tomorrow to finish going over the questions and calculations.  Next Steps:  In true inquiry fashion students jumped into a lab with limited background and are now ready to tease out the concepts!  In order to review the lab and process the concepts and questions use the next lesson to go over the students' data collection to see how it measures up to the model lab results and discuss why there is variation.  Also there seemed to be some confusion about how to represent average speed in number and units (distance/time) as some were averaging the trials instead.    The lab was a great way to get students thinking about electromagnetic waves and speed of light and with more discussion of the results they should be able to get a greater understanding of the concept.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0721577,2017,1102615,2016-11-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Greenblatt.     Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. Your students are benefiting from your well organized class and lesson presentation. You have established an environment for learning for all of your students. Students feel comfortable taking chances answering questions. In addition to the guiding questions posed to your students consider the questions below.     For students that are more advanced.  How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students?Why?    Thank you  Mr. Gregory Stanislaus
0725955,2014,21902,2013-10-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Your students are aware of the clear standards of conduct.You showed that you are aware of your students conduct and behavior based on how you made sure certain students were not sitting next to other students.     In terms of next steps:  We will start by focusing on the use of questioning and discussion techniques.In doing so we will work to develop questions that promote student thinking and understanding which would be evident through genuine discussion among students.  High order thinking questions are incorporated into the lesson plan in anticipation of an open discussion with your students.  In our next meeting we will work together to see how to incorporate this technique into the initial planning of the lesson.
0725955,2014,120418,2014-01-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Over the next two weeks I would like for you to review the Danielson Rubric. Doing this will give a clear direction on moving the class from areas of effective to highly effective.    The area that will be focused on the most will be questioning and discussion. I will forward several questioning templates on questioning and discussion. This will help you develop your ability to help students advance high level thinking and discourse and promote metacognition.
0725955,2014,286384,2014-04-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,You have established an environment of respect and rapport and have really engaged your student in learning beyond the classroom. You demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness to your students learning.     I will meet with you to discuss which areas of the Danielson Rubric you would like to focus on moving forward. One that we can look at together would be questioning and discussion techniques.   Thank you for your commitment and dedication to your students and Science department.
0725955,2014,298753,2014-05-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Reiss    I would like to have the opportunity to meet with you discuss the lesson plans you have developed to incorporate the topics in science in the overall Big Idea of Sustainability.  I am presently looking at the artifacts you have submitted and will be evaluating if any other artifacts will be needed before the end of the year.     Thank you for you commitment.
0725955,2014,457934,2014-05-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here you will find the results of the observation for May 30 2014.     As we prepare for another year in the science department the focus must be on the ability to engage the students in new experiences as you have done throughout the year while incorporating the full scope and sequence of the curriculum.We will discuss this during our upcoming planning meetings.    Thank you.
0725955,2014,481748,2014-06-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for June 4 2014.    As we prepare for another year we will now have time built into the schedule to meet as a grade. Together we will develop the rubrics to be used during each activity. In addition it is important that all students are aware of the entire project outlines and goals.
0725955,2015,565537,2014-12-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Jody  It was a pleasure to observe your young scientists during their dry-ice lab today!    Highlights:  Students were working in groups to write procedures hypotheses take measurements write observations and sketches calculate changes in volume and write conclusions.  The environment was safe and orderly as you facilitated the lab activity and student learning on writing a lab as well as concepts underlying phase change and volume calculations.    Wonderings:  To anchor the work in standards consider writing a chart of Essential Question and Learning Target for the day as well as documenting students thinking during a share time at the end of the lesson.  To help clear up any misconceptions and help guide the work of the lab report write up consider having this share/discussion in your next lesson when you introduce the lab format.    Thank you for your dedication and hard work!  Lenore Berner

It looked like a real laboratory!  Students used tea strainers cans plastic cups charcoal sponges cotton cloth and connectors to make a working water filter.  As a culminating task after weeks of studying the CELF science curriculum on the Water Cycle students were now testing the mechanics and effectiveness of their filters by pouring dirty water through their machines and trying to improve them based on their results.  Students had already made design blueprints and studied the water cycle and taken many related field trips including the Gowanus Canal.  Thank you for sharing your passion for ecology with your students and really making science come to life.

Students were engaged in various types of games and sports on the field and basketball courts.  Students were given a choice of activities and managing their own behavior based on the structures rules and protocols you have established with your class.  Thank you for providing this unique opportunity to your students on such a nice day to be outside.
0730456,2015,588695,2015-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Camp  Your students are given the responsibility to manage their tests and the responsibility to make them up when missed or for extra credit at the end of the marking period.  You worked with your co-teacher to manage this large group of students into smaller working groups of students.  The gym atmosphere is fun and exciting - students were running to the music and others were singing and dancing to the music as they supported the runners.  You monitored all groups and provided instruction as they transitioned from one activity to the next.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!

The lesson was fun interactive and interesting.  The students "got" the safety instructions as well as the rules of the game ("attack and don't come back").  The lesson was well received by grade 6 and the students were excited to start the game.
0730456,2015,643468,2015-03-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Camp  It was a pleasure to watch your lesson on Adalante Ball with your 7th graders.  Students rotated in teams to play the game as you and your co-teacher instructed refereed and kept score.  Students were engaged in playing the game keeping the clock setting up the pins and/or cheering on while waiting for their turn.  Adalante is an exciting game that requires team work coordination speed and accuracy.  Students were obviously having a great time.  With so many students to manage in the gym the level of coordination and cooperation is truly amazing.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to our PE program!

How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding about how to better take care of their bodies and maker good life choices?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0730456,2016,785918,2015-10-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Camp  It was a pleasure to visit you during the relay race class with your 6th graders. I was very impressed by how quickly they have adapted to the routines of the gym after only a few weeks of school.  You and your co-teacher managed the logistics of the race assessment and teams of students seamlessly.  It was fun to watch the students cheer as their classmates coordinated the passing of the batton and running techniques to complete the relay.  Thank you for supporting a student teacher in your class as well.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

The grade 7 students were working on completion of the fitness gram for NYC.  Both you and Mr. Gordon demonstrated the skills then the students moved to each station and completed the rubric component.  This is a required part of the PE program in NYC and the students understood the rubric as well as the rational.  This was a very interesting lesson.
0730456,2016,873358,2016-01-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Mr. Camp    It was a pleasure to observe your physical education class today; the routines and transitions are seamless and students were motivated to push their limits. Your classroom promotes health and wellness it blends coaching and healthy competition and middle school students can thrive in it.

This very large group (over 100 children) was engaged in learning about the Field Day activities and actively participating in demonstrations of the various skills.  The questions/answer session dealt with explaining and reviewing the various games and skills.  The students were active and really enjoyed the review and are looking forward to the "competition" of Field Day.  Thank you for all of the planning that is required for this very special event.

A goal for questioning and discussion could be to see if they can gain more independence and require less facilitation from you.  - You have many modes of checking for understanding in order to get a clear picture of mastery.  I was wondering how you keep track of student progress.  What is your system?  Thank you for your hard work and collaborative planning efforts!

The reading was engaging and appropriate for the class as you teach into this unit.  You discussion questions and prompts allowed students to think critically about the story.  Thank you for your dedication to your students.
0755452,2014,322898,2014-05-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,You have established an environment of respect and rapport. This is due to the instruction planning and preparation taking place in your class.     We should set up a meeting to discuss ways to continue to move the students forward. It will be interesting to hear what areas you would like to focus on with the students.     Thank you
0755452,2014,376923,2014-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Barbara  Students were using a Reading Response checklist and a modified handout as needed to write their response.  Students were using very high level vocabulary as they analyzed their texts for archetypes and used examples and quotes from the text to support their thesis.  It was very nice for these students to have quiet time to write and work closely with you on a day when they have 3 periods of ELA!  Thanks!
0755452,2015,596521,2015-01-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Barbara  It was a pleasure to see your class in the lab today working on their research claims for the aargument writing essay.  Students had choice in topics with excellent scaffolds and instruction as evidenced by the handouts students had completed earlier and used today as supports. Being well-prepared students were able to fully engage in the activity and use time efficiently.  You managed the students' use of the lab so that all students had support and access to the technology and learning.  Thank you for your dedication to your students' reading and writing achievement.
0755452,2015,693120,2015-04-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Buchalter    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. Your ability to modify the lesson continues to give your students greater opportunities to learn. What criteria is used for assessing the students work? and How did you check for student understanding throughout the lesson?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0755452,2015,729687,2015-05-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Buchalter  It was a pleasure to visit your poetry lesson with class 706.  Students read a poem "Skyscrapers" and analyzed it in groups and shared with the class.  You asked"What are skyscrapers representing?"  Students replied"supporting people a pillar strength."  You asked students to find the theme in the poem and students discussed this inquiry in small groups.  You visited each group and asked probing questions and students shared out.  Then students read another poem "Dust of Snow" and completed an activity to determine the poem's style and craft so that students can replicate it when they write their own poems.  The handout provided a checklist of craft moves that the students could identify in the poem as well as an assessment tool for you to check for understanding. Students were highly engaged in the work and carefully analyzed the poem using text evidence for each part of the checklist.  Thank you for your dedication and hardwork in creating a strong co-teaching culture for your students.
0755452,2015,740021,2015-05-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Buchalter    When I entered the room the students were working on the poetry project while you were conferencing with a student about his choices.  You asked him to clarify his thinking and make edits to the work that had been completed.  He was asked to explain his word choice and helped him to see how the choices that were being made changed the meaning in the paper.  When you finished with that student you moved to the groups to check in and then moved on to the next conference.    This was a well planned co-teaching conference time for the students and both teachers worked well together.  Please open your room to demonstrate how conferencing can work in a classroom.    Thank you for allowing me to observe this process.
0755452,2016,789060,2015-10-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,As discussed following the observation a gallery walk is a best teaching practice- students were all on task and provided positive constructive comments to their peers. It was great to see that you had also written a piece and that students were providing comments on it too.
0755452,2016,862747,2016-01-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Buchalter  It was a pleasure to observe your small group instruction as you guided students through the (modified) Memoir Checklist so that they could embark on their peer assessment and feedback.  Students had clear knowledge and skills in writer's craft exposition rising action climax and the resolution of stories as evidenced by the review and examples they provided for each section.  Students had their drafts partners and rubric ready to read assess and then provide feedback to their partners.  Students were also given a slip to document the most important piece of feedback from their partner that they would incorporate into the writing of their final draft.  Next Steps:  Although students were able to conjure up examples of 'past tense' or 'climax' of another story when reviewing the rubric consider asking students to use their own memoirs to provide some of the examples.  For example you might ask "Does anyone have a 'realization' in their story that they want to share?" or "Describe the climax of your story to your partner-turn and talk" or "Who can read aloud a sentence that shows past tense in their memoir?"  Thank you for your hard work dedication to your students and your excellent collaboration with your co-teacher.
0755452,2016,873409,2016-01-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Mrs. Buchalter    Thank you for another opportunity to observe your co-teaching classroom- you have a relationship with your colleague that serves as a model for best co-teaching practices.  Your lesson plan was thorough and all students were enthusiastic about completing work that engaged them in critical thinking skills.    Marcy Sterlis

Below please find a few questions to consider. I was not sure if the activity at the end of the lesson was for homework or classroom work.     How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?  How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?    Thank you  Mr. Stanislaus
0755452,2017,1064261,2016-10-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Buchalter    It is a pleasure watching you and Ms. Kasprzyk co-teach. Knowing some of the students with disabilities in that class I  was particularly impressed by their decisions to all participate in the Spelling Bee- this is a testament to the classroom environment that you and Ms. Kasprzyk have created.     Sincerely    Marcy

The students are ready for more rigor in the questioning technique.  Please continue to work to move the questions to a deeper understanding and allow the students to explain his/her thinking by supplying evidence for his/her reasoning (DOK level 3).  It is obvious that you have moved up the questioning technique from level 1 to level 2 continue on to level 3.  I look forward to observing this next month.

Please consider having the students chart the share out time.

0762628,2015,568577,2014-12-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Streko    Thank you for inviting me into your room.  I appreciate the work you are doing with the ELA teachers to make the school-wide focus of evidence in argument understandable to your students.  The interdisciplinary approach you are taking with Ms. Galang reinforces this work.    Wonderings:    How did you ask questions that made student's deepen their understanding?  How do you ask students to explain their thinking?  How have you made the students "partners" managing behaviors?    Next Steps:    Plan open-ended questions.  This might allow students to connect to text instead of just having a single thought right or wrong answer.  When a student answers a question question how they came to the answer.  This might extend the conversation.  Perhaps you can "teach" students how to help each other with behavior.  This can be done by recognizing positive behavior and working with the few individual students to create a system for them to monitor their own behavior (tracking system).    I look forward to our next observation and appreciate your sharing of your lesson plans with me.
0762628,2015,623881,2015-02-25 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Streko  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade social studies class as they analyzed the viewpoints of political cartoons.  You provided students with a mini lesson on how to identify the issue and viewpoints in the cartoon and provide evidence of findings in 5 easy steps with a handout for support.  Students worked in groups to do this work and you allowed about 15 minutes to share their findings.  You provided many open critical thinking questions such as "What is the artist's viewpoint of this political issue?  Proud or critical?  What is the evidence?".  Your homework assignment supported the task by asking them to create their own political cartoon to express a viewpoint on an issue regarding the American Age of Imperialism.    Wonderings:  This was a high level challenging task requiring analysis and interpretation of the cartoons.  How can we increase participation of those students who may have needed more support?  Perhaps you can spend more time going over other cartoons (easier level) and also reviewing the cartoons that students create for homework.  Thank you for your dedication to your students and your craft!
0762628,2015,725839,2015-05-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Streko     Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Please review the questions below to think about how to use questioning and discussion as a tool to deepen student understanding.     How do you use discussion among students? Why?  How can you connect pair group and class discussions to writing and opportunities to extend thinking?    Thank you     Mr. Stanislaus
0762628,2015,768302,2015-06-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,The class was working to prepare a debate.  They were using FDR's speech to cite evidence pro/con entering WWII.  The students had hard copies in front of them after listening to an audio with FDR giving the speech.    Mr. Streko    You have worked this year to fully encompass the school-wide focus of evidence in argument.  You continually reminded the students to back up his/her argument with evidence.  Please continue to work with the students and deepen the questions as they become more adept at citing "real" evidence from credible sources.  Thank you for allowing me to observe this lesson.
0762628,2016,797522,2015-10-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Streko  It was a pleasure to watch your lesson on 'How to Improve in Writing the Argument Essay' after you assessed a baseline assessment task on the topic of Reconstruction after the Civil War.  After the assessment but prior to this lesson students have been studying 'what makes a good argument' and you have provided many tools to help them understand the parts of the argument essay via mentor texts the school wide argument rubric and activities in deconstructing an essay to its basic parts in an outline.  Today students were looking at their scored essays and setting goals based on your feedback.  They were also able to voice their need by selecting future writing lessons (next steps) via a survey you provided them.  In our grade meeting that same day I joined you as you planned with ELA teachers in your grade on how you would provide these writing lessons to the students collaborately between the subject areas.  Next Steps:  In thinking about the flow of the lesson and how students learn you may consider flipping the activity you planned with the homework activity:  have students in groups complete the deconstruction of the sample Reconstruction essay in class and then complete the review of their own personal essay and goal setting/survey for homework. The deconstruction activity would really drive home the major points of 'what makes a great argument essay' so that when they look over their own essay it may help them identify areas of need and improvement.  Perhaps they could even rewrite portions of their own essay as a follow up.  Wonderings:  Looking forward to seeing how their writing improves over the year and how you and the ELA teachers divide and conquer!  Thank you so much for your dedication to this writing work in the content areas as evidenced by the excellent writing in your class.
0762628,2016,875173,2016-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Streko    The EQ for this lesson was "How did the Progressives bring the government closer to the people?" The skill being focused on was: "Improving our writing with appositives"  This lesson using appositives was a great follow-up to your presentation you made to the staff during PD.  The lesson was very well planned and the students were working effectively in groups and the discussions were rich with facts.  You moved to each group to check in and shared out with the entire class. The students were highlighting within the text and were able to identify where examples gave more detail.  The students knew how to cite evidence when they answered the questions.  I am looking forward to the next writing piece and your data on student improvement based on your work with the ELA strands.  Thank you for inviting me into this lesson.
0762628,2016,956038,2016-03-31 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Streko    When I entered the class you were working with the EQ:  How can we interpret the purpose position and/or message of music and poetry about WWI?    The students had copies of two poems and were having discussions in groups about how the artist communicated the position (pro/anti war) and what evidence can support the student's argument.  You made connections to prior lessons on nuanced writing and the students identified a number of techniques that they recognized (cadence imagery foreshadow etc.) and how the authors used the techniques.    You then played a section of music and the students were provided with the lyrics to dissect in the groups.  This lesson made connections to music and ELA using a historical lens.  The students made connections using prior knowledge and the discussions in the groups I observed was deep and all students participated.  Thank you for an exciting lesson.
0762628,2016,1007310,2016-05-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Streko    The EQ:  "In what ways did Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt view the constitutional "role of government" differently?" was an interesting starting point for the class discussion.  You had the students review an article an create a t-chart citing evidence.  This lesson made connections to ELA as the students were required to 'paint a picture with words".  You also made connections to conservatism vs. liberalism and current politics.    This lesson can be used as a starting point for a discussion of social programs (New Deal) and the role of private charity in helping the citizenry.  The requirement of evidence in argument helps to maintain accuracy and civility in the discussions.  I look forward to the final product.
0762628,2017,1079182,2016-11-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Streko  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade social studies class as they were learning about craft (nuanced writing) and how that can strengthen an argument in a persuasive essay.  You made reference to the argument writing rubric used in 8th grade and created an activity for students to discover nuance in writing using 2 examples of writing about Wounded Knee.  Students worked in groups to identify what the authors' wanted them to think and feel with their writing as well the techniques they used to make that happen.  Highlights:  This lesson tied many skills they may have learned in ELA to their social studies writing.  You asked students to explore nuance techniques more deeply and to transfer that knowledge as they prepare to write a nuanced social studies argument essay.  Please invite me back as students begin to write and apply this writing technique to their essays.  I would be happy to help you conference with students and support you in learning more about strategic feedback.  Thanks for your hard work and dedication to teaching writing skills in social studies.
0762628,2017,1102560,2016-11-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Streko    Thank you for inviting me into the first (of many I hope) forays into the use of technology into your Social Studies class.  This was a review to assess knowledge.  The students were divided into teams and worked together to answer a series of questions about Industrialization and the Captains of Industry.  The students used the phones to connect to the smart board to record the answers that they had chosen.  This activity became very competitive.  The students seemed to know the material.    Next Steps:  Perhaps in the time between questions you can ask why a group chose an answer (when it was incorrect) so that there can be a discussion to clarify misconceptions.    Wondering:  How were the groups created?  What is the follow-up to this activity?    I commend you for finding interesting and dynamic ways to review materials. You are always very open to change and suggestions from colleagues as well as willing to share your best practices.  This lesson is filled with potential as you become more familiar with the technology.

The students can explain/justify the thinking that they used to create the diagrams in writing as a part of the task.

The students work hard to find information from the text but don't yet go to the next step of discussion (rather than just repeating the "right" answer).

I appreciate your willingness to speak with me regarding the learning targets and lesson plans.  Please continue to deepen the questions that are being asked and have the students explain how they know what they know.
0763055,2014,444589,2014-06-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The students were working on drawing the manor.  This activity was fun for the students but perhaps the students could have done some individual research before the project.  This might allow the discussion to go deeper and the students to bring in more of his/her own insight.  When you used specific words (like fallow) the students were able to bring in prior knowledge to work out the meaning this was wonderful when they worked together to decode.

0763055,2015,507925,2014-10-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Catapano thank you so much for inviting me into your 610 class.  The students were working so diligently on the essay project and really knew what the assignment was and could explain the thinking that they used in the writing.    Wonderings:    How can the students see that this piece is connected to a larger theme?  Would it be possible to have a "Big Idea" posted that this would relate to?  I noticed your work on the pangaea and the geography vocabulary and was able to make the connection but I wonder if the students would be able to do the same as easily.
0763055,2015,607291,2015-01-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Catapano    Thank you for opening up you class to me. Moving forward one of the focus areas for our teachers will be to develop the questioning and discussion techniques for the students.     Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus
0763055,2015,684885,2015-04-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Catapano  It was a pleasure to visit your ICT 6th-grade social studies lesson exploring whether or not Rome was the center of the Roman Empire. Students used math skills and the map scale to measure and calculate the distances between Rome and other cities in the Empire as well as the total size of the Empire.  Students worked independently and teachers assisted students as needed.  Students also helped each other as they prepared to share their findings on the board.  You also made sure that students who needed assistance were still able to share their responses on the board so that all students felt they could contribute.  Students were enthusiastic as they engaged in the lesson.  Wonderings:  Students worked diligently to mathematically calculate and discover that Rome was not the center of the Roman Empire.  However you never got to the final discussion question you had planned "Why would it be a disadvantage to not be the center of the Empire?" I think that was a great question that would have made students discuss and think more deeply about how the power of the empire may have been effected by the geography.  I also enjoyed the creative presentations that students showcased at the end of the lesson about the lifestyle conditions of living in Sparta or Athens.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

You have shown great commitment and dedication to your students. Moving forward think about    How do yu ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen student understanding?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?  How do activities and assignments promote students thinking?    Mr. G Stanislaus
0763055,2016,871284,2016-01-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Catapano    The Learning Target for this lesson was I can list and interpret the various ways Egyptian doctors have added to the knowledge of medicine.  When I entered the room the students were individually creating a graphic organizer which would list 4 reasons people go to the doctor.  When the majority of the students completed the task the students stood on 2 lines to articulate 1 reason that they had listed and then they sat down.  This same procedure was done but with the time frame of 2700-1100 BC.      The students then moved to a reading passage and notes were given.    Commendation:    This is an ICT grade 6 class and it is very important for the students to be able to get up and move.  The "check in" allowed for that movement.    Areas for improvement:    The students repeated the same answers many times perhaps after the answer was given (and it was correct) the students could check it off and try a different answer.  If a student had all 4 answers given before they had a chance to share perhaps they could go first on the next check.  The students didn't listen to each other.  After they gave an answer and returned to the seat they did not pay attention to different answers or write down anything that they had not thought of previously.  Perhaps the students could listen more actively and then add additional material to the work that they had completed.    Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this lesson.
0763055,2016,928954,2016-03-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Catapano  It was a pleasure to visit your social studies class with 610.  In your minilesson you reviewed the second Persian war battle details previewing the information before students read it from the text.  Using your map on the board students were able to articulate the problems that the Athenians and Spartans faced against the Persians and how the island of Salamis gave refuge and created a naval victory for Athens. Students were able to identify the bigger issues of the nation and think about the quality of life in Athens and Sparta.  You forecasted how students would soon be deciding on which city they would rather live in and why.  You then returned to your read-a-loud historical fiction text Escape from Egypt."      Next Steps:  -You have provided many opportunities for your students to read and listen to nonfiction and historical fiction texts.  Providing them critical thinking discussion questions on this topic would also help them articulate their ideas verbally and in writing as well.  For example before having students come to the board to share allow everyone a minute or 2 to discuss with a partner how Athens won the battle.      -Also consider having everyone write an argument essay on your question "Would you rather live in Sparta or Athens?" using the evidence they have gathered in their research before they create their skits/commercials.  While the skits are a great way to allow for creative expression writing and debating their claims would give more practice in writing evidence for their argument.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0763055,2016,977913,2016-04-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Catapano    Thank you for allowing me to observe this grade 6 class.      When I entered the room you were providing the students with notes to copy from the board on the topic "Why Rome Fell".  The students copied them as you were writing.  The students had read the section about the topic previously in the text. You asked the students some questions about the notes as you were writing. When the students completed copying the notes you checked the work in the notebooks.  Upon completion of this tasknotebooks were put away and you moved on to reading a section from Escape from Egypt.    Wondering:    Could the students have created the notes themselves in small groups?  If each group was able to discuss the question "Why Rome Fell" they might come to very interesting conclusions and become more engaged in the lesson.  The share out could codify the notes so that all of the students had some uniform answers.  Could the questions be more designed to promote critical thinking skills and allow for more class discussion?      Please choose a different novel for the class.  We discussed this last year there are many interesting novels available and they can be purchased for your classroom.  Also please consider how you use the novel.  Whole class round robin reading and reading aloud can be interspersed with book clubs or student lead inquiry.  Students could look at critical thinking discussion questions and use them as a way to focus a discussion about a section of the book.  Perhaps we can create an updated classroom library of fiction and non fiction books about the topics that you are covering in the Social Studies class so that students can choose from a variety of titles and levels of reading.

You and your co teacher work together to ensure that all students are being prepared for the next level of their educational experience. Below please see questions that will support you in the are of questions and discussiona.     How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  What criteria or tools did you use to craft your questions?  How do you use discussion among students ? Why?  How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?

You have developed a great working relationship with both paraprofessionals in your class. You continue to demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness to your students diverse ways of learning.     Next steps.   As a department the two areas we will focus on will be on using assessment during instruction. This is labeled 3 (d) in the Danielson rubric. We will work to ensure that students are aware of the assessment criteria and the teacher will monitor student learning for groups of students.   Also we will look at 3 (b) Using questioning and Discussion Techniques. The goal is for you to continue to create a genuine discussion among students providing adequate time for students to respond and stepping aside when doing so is appropriate.     I will forward a few templates that may assist in these areas.  Thank you for you dedication to you profession.

You were working with three students while your co-teacher was modeling problem solving using the Distributive Property on the interactive Smartboard.  You visited several other students as they practiced problems and guided their learning by asking questions and reminding them of important steps as needed.  I actually couldn't tell who were the students with IEPs as many of the students were working successfully independently and in groups.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

You continue to show a dedication and commitment to your students that encourage and motivate them to want to learn. Think about the following questions as you move forward in your teaching.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you connect pair group and class discussions to writing and / or opportunities to extend thinking?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus

0776407,2016,872502,2016-01-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. LaForestrie    Your lesson on recall was an effective way to review the chapters and prepare students for the lesson that you mentioned was tomorrow- students were going to watch the Winn Dixie Movie and make comparisons to the book.    Movement from "Effective" to "Highly Effective" in the components 3b. 3c. and 3d. requires student ownership of learning. For example in 3b. the difference between the two is "Students formulate many questions initiate topics challenge one another’s thinking and make unsolicited contributions. Students themselves ensure that all voices are heard in the discussion." These are often difficult to do but if you are interested I'd be happy to discuss and come up with ideas to implement in your classroom.    Marcy Sterlis
0776407,2016,882331,2016-01-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. LaForestrie  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade ELA reading lesson culminating your study on the book "Because of Winn Dixie."  Students had read the book and seen the movie and you started class by discussing the differences betweem them and why they preferred one to the other.  You then introduced a list of creative projects from which students could choose.  Students were so excited about the choices they begged to complete more than one!  After you assessed their choices students began to plan out their work.  Here are some next steps to help you enhance your practice in domain 3:  1 - While students did an excellent job in explaining why they liked the movie/book better than the other consider making this a student-to-discussion first and then a share-out to the class.  This will allow all students to be heard by and accountable to their peers and easier to limit the sharing time to one per student. (3b)  2 - It may have been helpful to review the project rubric in the packet before they got started so that everyone is clear on your expectations and has a guide to check their work.(3d)  3 - Although you provided models and explanations for some of the projects consider having additional scaffolds and models available or a template/organizer for some of the more abstract projects in case a student needed more help in getting started. (3c)  Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to your students.  Your classroom is beautiful and your collaboration with your para has resulted in a positive outcome for your students.

You have a wonderful rapport with your students- for 8th graders to be fully engaged writing and responding to text first thing on a Monday morning is quite a testament to your teaching your management of paraprofessionals and your understanding of how middle school students (including students with disabilities) learn best.    Sincerely    Marcy

You change instruments quickly and deftly which keeps the students interested and allows each section ample opportunity to learn the individual section.
0790999,2014,169303,2014-02-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,mr. Gozzo I am always impressed by the many instruments that you teach and work with during a given instructional period.  i observed your conversation with a parent during the parent/teacher conference.  You were professional and helped the parent find an additional opportunity to plan for the child to continue with music instruction over the summer months.

You demonstrating using a sax with the back row of students (sax players)and instructed the other students to "finger along".  You worked with the alto and base then moved on to the flutes.  The students were able to have immediate feedback as you assessed the playing.  Next you took a clarinet to model the next section.  You asked students to model as well and had students demonstrate how to "temper" the instrument.  Finally you moved to the trombones and had them move slides until they achieved the correct sound.    The students were able to comprehend the changes and self-corrected as necessary.  I was amazed with the change in the quality of the sound from the start of the section to the mid point.
0790999,2015,631377,2015-03-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Gozzo    I want to thank you for a wonderful experience in your classroom. It was amazing to see the building blocks of a full score of music. Now I am aware of what takes place before the wonderful performance I have had the opportunity to witness. You are doing a magnificent work with our students.    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0790999,2015,658147,2015-03-25 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Tony  It was a great pleasure to watch you teach and conduct your 7th grade band class and listen to them practicing the song Aztec Fire.  You connected the music to math on several occasions and students were highly engaged and focused on the thinking work that is required while playing music.  They took notes on your suggestions and you gave them confidence ("You don't need me!") as they successfully worked through difficult parts of the song.  They sounded wonderful and as you worked on each section of instruments their playing improved significantly.  Your approach to teaching music is a perfect example of assessment in instruction with immediate feedback and evidence of progress improvement and mastery of the task.  Bravo!  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!
0790999,2015,693255,2015-04-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Gozzo    Thank you for allowing me to listen in on the class.  The students were working in sections and together to learn pieces of music.  The students were asked many questions regarding timing finger positions and also were asked to demonstrate proper technique.  This beginner class has made great leaps forward since the fall and the music in the room (that is very recognizable) is proof.
0790999,2016,824262,2015-11-25 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Gozzo    Thank you for allowing me to observe your grade 8 class.  When I entered the room you were working on a piece of music by Stevie Wonder with the majority of students who played a variety of instruments.  The few students who are (non-players) part of the music appreciation program were working on the computers with headsets completing an assignment on the same music.  All of the students were engaged and the instruction was differentiated for the students based on ability and which program they are part of within the group.    Please continue to work with the paraprofessionals to have them assist the students who are part of the music appreciation group.
0790999,2016,889547,2016-01-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Gozzo    When I entered your classroom you were working with the Grade 7 students on the "Celtic Air and Dance" piece of music.  The students were playing and you were modeling the sounds by playing a variety of instruments.  You helped the child on the Xylophone when he struggled with the piece by playing the piano to signal him he then understood.  You also helped the students with the questions that they had about the timing.  The students worked together to understand the timing and where each instrument came in they also conferred with each other to work on the "fingering".    This class is amazing to watch.  The talent that you have and the talent that you have helped to cultivate in the students is wonderful.  Your generosity of time (lunch REAL etc)to help students become better more confident players is an asset to this program.    Thank you for inviting me into this class.
0790999,2016,908268,2016-02-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Gozzo  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade instrumental music class as they were learning Mission Impossible.  You had the class play measures 35-51 first slowly then faster and faster with each trial.  You were focusing on accuracy of the notes and fingering making sure that students were playing the right notes.  Students sounded like they were ready for their individual tests and you encouraged volunteers to sign up.  Students asked questions as needed to clarify their parts of the music.  Each section then played without the other instruments.  When students weren't playing they were required to count out the beats or finger their part in order to practice without playing listen to the part and keep engaged in the lesson.  They sounded fantastic!  Thank you so much for your tireless efforts and dedication to your program!

The students posed many questions.  You then reviewed when to breathe in a selection of music while at the same time fixed a stuck valve on a trumpet.  You multitask very well.    The students who are not "instrument players" were fully engaged in a computer music lesson.    Thank you for allowing me to come into your class at this very hectic time of concert preparation.

You also had the students demonstrate that he/she could complete the task without help.  You then moved on to the practice sections of the music book.  The students labeled the work that they were to complete individually and in sections (by instruments).  You asked for a volunteer to demonstrate the exercise for the rest of the section then had the section respond by repeating the piece of music.  You made corrections as they worked and students helped each other with the sections.  The students were anxious to model for each other and to show what they had already accomplished using the individual instrument.   This is a very large class with many instruments and some of the students were not patient when waiting for his/her instruments turn to play.    Thank you for allowing me to observe your class today.

You have created an environment of respect and rapport and all of your students have demonstrated that they understand what is expected of the class.    You have incorporated using assessment into your instruction. Having the students review the rubric and explain why they believed they met certain criterion us well done.     Next Steps:   As we move throughout the year as a math department we will continue to develop our questioning and discussion techniques. The goal is to get the students to initiate higher order questions. In addition the teacher builds on and uses students responses to questions in order to deepen student understanding.     I will arrange another class visit and let you know when. This will take place before the end of January.

When I visit your class again I will look at assessment in the instruction.     What are the criteria for assessing the student work?  How do the students know the assessment criteria?  How do you provide students with feedback on their progress?    Thank you   Mr. G Stanislaus
0797461,2015,740129,2015-05-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Lippolis    This grade 6 project is allowing the students to see math as fun.  The students were working diligently to create a question that could be surveyed and provide enough information to allow them to create a mean median and mode.  You were helping the students with the questions and allowing them to correct the mistakes.  The students trust you and wanted to create a great question.    Next Steps:    Perhaps when you are reviewing the project at the start of the class you might consider allowing the students to answer each other's questions rather than fielding all of them yourself.  This might deepen the questions and in turn the understanding of the project.
0797461,2015,717183,2015-05-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lippolis  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade math class as they were working on their survey statistics project.  You had taught a series of lessons (as seen in students' notebooks) on mean median mode range and random sampling to support the work of this project.  Students worked in groups to develop a survey question (When do you think the school was built? How much lunch money do you spend per week? What is your grade point average?) collect data and analyze and graph the data.  Students were creative engaged and working on various parts of the project at their group's pace.  You were supporting each group by asking thinking questions "What would be a more quantitative survey question?" and helping students make decisions about the next steps of their project.  Next Steps:  For next year consider creating a 'teacher approval process' before students begin their survey so that students are sure to have a quantitative survey question that would generate a true mean median and mode.  I know that there was a rubric created by your grade team but I didn't see any students using it.  The rubric is a helpful organizational guide as well as a self-assessment tool to use as they work through the many parts of this project.  Thank you for your dedication to your students!
0797461,2015,769835,2015-06-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Lippolis    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. Your level of commitment and dedication to you students have prepared them for the next level in their academic journey. You continue to structure your lessons to intellectually engage the students. I look forward to working with you in the upcoming year. Have a great summer.    Thank You    Mr. Stanislaus
0797461,2016,798901,2015-10-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Lippolis    Thank you for the open invitation to visit your class. You have managed to engage all of your students and created an environment of respect and learning. As we move forward we will focus on the questioning and discussion techniques.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?    Thank you  Mr. Stanislaus
0797461,2016,880393,2016-01-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Lippolis    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Your students clearly know what is expected of them and work towards that standard. Your sense of humor and style brings a tone to the environment that supports classroom learning and involvement. Please review the questions below.    What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?  What strategies do you and your co teacher use to check for student understanding throughout the lesson?  How do the students use the assessment criteria to check their work?    Thank you  Mr. Stanislaus
0797461,2016,900458,2016-02-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Lippolis     I enjoyed observing your classroom today; your have a wonderful rapport with your students and you took time to ensure they understood "How do we connect multiplying decimals to multiplying fractions?" by engaging them in discussion and having them use their notes as a resource.    Recommendation:  While you and Ms. Hogan utilized the co-teaching model "One Teach One Assist" it does not always create a powerful instructional partnership to effectively support all students. During this lesson a different model may have been more effective than Ms. Hogan supporting a small number of individual students.     Sincerely    Marcy Sterlis
0797461,2016,987560,2016-05-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lippolis  It was a pleasure to visit your math lesson with class 610.  You reminded students that everything they have learned in math is interconnected.  On the screen was a circle and students described and discussed how they drew circles yesterday and how circles are a number of points all at an equal distance from the center radius. You made the point that angles and fractions are related and demonstrated how an angle is formed/rotated on a circle measured in degrees and then as a fraction.  Students used the diagram to draw and show 90 degree angles in the circle and how various rotations around the circle could be drawn to create different angles and fractions.  Students had profound discoveries: "If we rotate more than 1/4 but less than 1/2 around the circle we create an obtuse angle."  They created straight reflex obtuse acute and 90 degree angles and divided angles.  In the activity they had the choice of creating many types of angles in their circle drawings naming and measuring them.  You have a wonderful rapport with your students and make learning math fun!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0797461,2017,1083514,2016-11-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Lippolis    Thank you for allowing me to visit your classroom.  I wanted to start by saying it was a pleasure to see how you and your co-teacher worked together. The planning that must have gone into your lesson was obvious evidenced by the seamless flow from teacher to teacher. The environment is such that all students are engaged and excited by the routines established in your class. Please review the questions below.    How do you use discussion among students? Why?  How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?    Thank you    Mr. Gregory Stanislaus
0797461,2017,1093971,2016-11-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lippolis  It was a pleasure to visit your math lesson with class 606. Students completed a do now and pasted notes into their math notebooks while homework was checked.  You used many different routines to build community and engagement while maintaining engagement such as "put your hands on your head if you are done shake hands to agree and da-da-da-clap."  After the do now you taught the mini lesson on adding fractions while you co-teacher conferred with small groups.  In your lesson you had them drawing fractional pieces to better understand the concept as well as having them work with improper fractions mixed numbers and common denominators as they began to add fractions.    Highlights:  The lesson was well-paced clear and coherent building on the content from the day before and the do now.  Your room is bursting with visual resources to help students comprehend content methods routines and expectations: Habits of Mind chart Independent Learner Rubric Accountable Talk rubric word Wall Parking Lot for Questions shelves of materials and homework board with a week's worth of homework.  You have a wonderful rapport with your students which added to their level of engagement and achievement.  Next Steps:  Would the use of manipulatives add another level of access to this lesson?  Let me know if you need more resources for your learning environment.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0799064,2014,180372,2014-03-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Shelly I really enjoyed watching you teach class 707.  Students' high level of critical thinking and engagement during the activity was truly impressive.  Students used the graphic organizer to analyze the poems and make connections to their own lives.    Next Steps:  In addition to your overall learning target/inquiry - "How does author's craft create a specific tone in the poem?" consider posting a few specific questions on the screen that you can use throughout the lesson to assess/track student learning such as "How can you support your idea with evidence?" and "Why do you think the author used that structure imagery or craft move?"  These questions (or similar) will not only help you assess students but help the students formulate their upcoming essay ideas.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!

Your contributions to the meeting were most valuable.  Next Steps:  Let's keep the energy around labsites going so we can continue them even when Maggie is not here!
0799064,2014,266265,2014-04-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Cunningham  It was such a pleasure to observe your class today as they worked on developing the characters and the conflict of their independent writing.  You conferenced with many groups to guide their inquiries the development of their writing and redirect when needed.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!
0799064,2014,280082,2014-04-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Shelly this was a great class!  Next Steps:  To increase participation and engagement consider giving the audience a rubric to score (a checklist or narrative based off the rubric) so that while they are watching the scene they can think critically about how the group has met the criteria of the project.  It can be more celebratory than critical if you like but provide useful feedback for the group while asking the audience to think further.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your craft!
0799064,2014,312478,2014-05-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Shelly  Your students were highly engaged in acting watching and reading the scenes.  The question/answer period after each scene was impressive - students asked critical thinking questions and each actor responded with deep thought and insight.  Romeo and Juliet has been well received by your students and is a great tool for teaching how to read difficult text while exploring their creativity.
0799064,2014,402492,2014-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Shelly  This is a great writing project for June.  Students engaged in creating their super-hero origin story using a graphic novel/comic-book-like layout you have provided.  Your graphic organizers were very helpful for types of learners.  Thank you!
0799064,2015,639734,2015-03-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Cunningham    Thank you for allowing me to observe your class as they were working on the poetry unit.  The students were working on a poetry scavenger hunt using poetry handouts which were on the tables.  You reviewed the unit plan and specific vocabulary that was being used.  You then did a demonstration using a "Mother Goose" story.  The students began individual work and then moved on to working in the larger groups.  This lesson was a great introduction into poetry in a variety forms.
0799064,2015,660023,2015-03-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms.Cunningham  It was a pleasure to watch your lesson on 'tackling difficult vocabulary' in the context of a nonfiction article in Upfront magazine with class 808.  Students quickly created a graphic organizer in their notebooks which you displayed on the screen. You populated the chart with challenging vocabulary they would encounter in the article called The Atom Bomb. First you reviewed how this strategy might be useful on the upcoming ELA state exam and how the test might ask for the meaning synonym antonym or connotation of a word.  Students also offered their own strategies (prior knowledge) for making meaning of vocabulary that they don't know or have never used.  This lesson was a great way to teach an invaluable life skill while connecting it to the practical use of this skill on the state exam. Consider adding a blank box in the chart if students feel the need to add another word that they found challenging!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0799064,2015,663731,2015-03-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Cunningham    Thank you for allowing me to visit with your class. Below please find some questions to think about as we prepare to close the school year.     What were the criteria for assessing the students' work?  How did the students know the assessment criteria?  How do you check for student understanding throughout the lesson?    You continue to do excellent work with all of your students. It was a pleasure to visit with them.    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0799064,2015,740007,2015-05-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Shelly  It was a pleasure to see 711 students engaged in your book club reading groups as they pulled together their post-it trails.  Students were creating a poster that included their inquiry question and all the post-it notes of ideas that they had written while reading the book and thinking about their inquiry question.  They jotted evidence from the text as they read to answer their question and now they were compiling their ideas creating a 'post-it trail.' Students were engaged in discussions about the book evidence from the text as it pertained to their inquiry question and organizing their post-it thoughts in a way that made sense to the reader.  Some groups were taking their ideas and doing additional research around their inquiry questions such as research on places in the world where similar things might be happening. The post-it trail posters were creative and informative allowing the readers to think critically about the book and their query as well as readers of the poster to learn more about the book.  Thank you so much for your dedication to your craft and to your students!
0799064,2016,865070,2015-12-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Cunningham    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. Your students are taught to take responsibility for their learning and your facilitator stlye of teaching allows this process.Here are a few questions to consider in the area of questioning and discussion techniques.     How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students ? Why?    Thank You   Mr. G Stanislaus
0799064,2016,896091,2016-02-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Cunningham    When I entered the room the students were working on a poetry unit and you chose to connect it to music by incorporating Bob Seger's song "Turn the Page".  The students listened to it and had the lyrics written out.  They then reflected individually before the class shared in groups then to the whole.  The students were digging deep into the lyrics and making comparisons focusing on simile symbol and simile.  They cited evidence from the song and built on each other's work.  The students were motivated and working on task as they shared within the groups and respectful of the opinions of others as they shared as a whole.    Thank you for inviting me into the grade 7 ELA class this afternoon.
0799064,2016,954829,2016-03-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Cunningham  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade ELA class as they created 'post-it trails' around a theme in Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare.  The post-it trail reflected member's thoughts about their theme as the plot unfolds in Act II.  The student's came up with three themes to follow: Individual vs. Society Love and Fate and different groups selected one of the themes and synthesized their post-it ideas analyzing whether or not their ideas reinforced contradicted or altered their thinking around the theme.  Students methodically read and analyzed each group member's post-its to apply to their post-it trail.  Students also had evidence of group-thinking work in their notebooks using graphic organizers to organize their post-it evidence to support their theme.  Students quoted and analyzed text - one group even created a quandrant reflecting variations in 'impulsivity of the characters' and how that effected society vs. self.    I'm excited to see how these critical thinking trails lead to thoughtful and well-developed literary essays!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

Next Steps:   Consider an additional 'check for understanding' so that you can push students' thinking in meeting the learning target by having them complete an exit slip answering the question:  How did the character change and how do you know? Provide evidence from the text to support your idea.  This student data you collect can be organized by learning target/standards in reading and writing to help you create your learning groups.
0817800,2014,72940,2013-12-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Next Steps:  Let's work on your (3b) Questioning and Discussion Techniques this year.  Plan your questions in a lesson as a scaffold.  They should start with the low level questions and work up to high order level thinking.  While I know this is difficult with many of your SWD it can be a goal for you and your students.  While they should be able to "identify" or "define" (DOK level 1) the text features in the lesson try giving more wait time (so that you are not answering your own question!) and try asking one higher level question in the end that starts with a "why" or a "how".  Thanks so much for your hard work and dedication.
0817800,2014,300572,2014-05-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Cuccia  It is always a pleasure to visit your class.  Your 7th graders were engaged in the workshop reading activity and were enthusiastically participating in the discussion.  Using a grade level text with our special education students can be challenging but you employed many techniques to engage them and guided them through the shared reading.  Next Steps:  The challenge lies in developing their independence.  How can you move them to being more independent learners?    I am sure as you reflect on this year and these students you can quantify how much they have grown and how much closer they are to reaching grade level standards.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!

How are the questions you ask specific guiding and open-ended as appropriate in order to scaffold students' critical thinking?    How do you ensure that all students have access to questions and discussion?     Thank you
0817800,2015,639708,2015-03-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Cuccia  It was a pleasure to visit your ELA lesson on Argument reading and writing with class 601.  You have clearly taught them the elements of (and vocabulary pertaining to) reading Argument articles using scholastic's ACTION magazine and identifying claim and counterclaim.  You modeled reading and thinking aloud to prepare students for the activity.  In your activity students read a brief argument and identified the claim and evidence to support the writer's claim.  You assessed each student's progress and supported their small group work and work with paras in the room. Your room was complete with instructional charts and Learning Targets.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0817800,2015,648454,2015-03-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Cuccia    Thank you for allowing me to come into the 602 class.  The article that you were using was very interesting and the students seemed to enjoy it.  You started the class with a chart and a review of the vocabulary.  You notated on the chart and the students contributed to the conversation.  The students were asked to annotate and summarize the article and you demonstrated the skill by using the projection.  You worked well with the various needs of the class and the difficulty some of the students had in reading the article.  Wondering:  How is assessment used in the lesson?  Do the student's know the criteria for the assessment?

The lesson on Hurricane Katrina and how you used it to teach reading /writing was very impressive. Please think about the questions below.    What are the criteria for assessing the students' work?  How do the students know the assessment criteria?  How do you know when all students have met the learning outcome?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0817800,2015,747449,2015-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Cuccia  It was a pleasure to visit your ELA class with your 6th graders on essay writing.  Students had prior knowledge of the parts of a 5-paragraph essay and you reviewed them with a fun activity whereby students had to order the 5-paragraph cut-outs of an essay by reading it first.  Students worked collaboratively in groups and accomplished the task with some assistance from the adults in the room. They also had to label the parts once they ordered them correctly.  You then gave the students a graphic organizer to start them off in writing their own 5-paragraph essay.  You provided a simple prompt: Write about someone (famous) you admire and would like to meet.  Tell us why. You reminded the students to use the same or similar topic sentences as seen in the first activity using mentor texts.  You also had excellent instructional charts in the room that students referred to throughout the lesson.    Next Steps:  Many students struggled with deciding on the person they would write about.  Perhaps limiting their choices by changing the prompt to a family member or teacher would help them decide more quickly and get to the writing.    It is always a pleasure to watch you teach.  Your students learn so much from your high expectations and organized lessons. Thank you for your dedication and hard work!
0817800,2016,821440,2015-11-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Cuccia    It was a pleasure to visit your classroom. Students were engaged because you make learning enjoyable- you provide examples and model responses and you understand middle school students- the article you used was relevant and it "connected" students and the article you used in a previous lesson on rats most definitely left an impression on them!    If you review the Danielson continuum to move from "Effective" to "Highly Effective" in the areas of"Questioning and discussion techniques" and "Using assessment in instruction" the difference is teacher directed vs. student directed- for example "students initiate higher order thinking" and "students have helped establish evaluation criteria." If either of these are areas that you would like to focus on I'd be happy to support you with them.    I look forward to observing your classroom again.    Sincerely    Marcy

Additionally the way you have set up the classroom to have your classroom paraprofessional work with a pre-determined group of students while the 1:1 paraprofessional sits with his student using an application of his phone to track behavior data creates a supportive working environment for your students.

Students were completing their story elements after completing a plot mountain.  Some students were still researching the book and looking back at plot mountains to identify each element (main character setting into point of view two main characters rising action climax) while others were already typing out their responses to each section.  Some were writing in paragraph form and others organizing by listing each element.  Some were writing directly onto the organizer.  You encouraged students to look at how each student was organizing their information differently to help scaffold their writing.  This activity was a precursor to writing about reading in a literary essay format.  Your paras and ESL teacher assisted with students so that every student who needed direct instruction received it.  Next Steps:  Please continue to attend ELA grade meetings and special TC PDs this year.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

You were discussing the playwright festival and the students were sharing his/her impression of the event and the various plays that they viewed.  You asked very open ended pointed questions (...what was it like for you...why do you think that violence is an inherently ...) that required the students not only to state an opinion but justify the opinion with evidence (...in SS class I learned that..using violence a playwright puts the action in front of your eyes...)You then connected the discussion to the play that the class is currently rehearsing for presentation.  You asked each actor to speak to the violence in the play and why the character would see it as right. You asked them to cite examples from the character (...you're dismissing your character...you need to get inside the head of the character...). Next you started vocal warm-ups in order to move on to the actual rehearsal.    Thank you for allowing me to see the process that is used with grade 6.  The students were challenged and know that drama is not just memorization of lines.
0842388,2015,661379,2015-03-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. McEneny  It was such a pleasure to watch the 7th grade Production of Dracula on Saturday.  The performances were exceptional and the scenery costumes music and script(s) are testament to the incredible teamwork between you and your students parents and staff.  In your blackbox theater you provide a safe space for actors to take risks explore their characters and learn their roles and lines of the script over several weeks in rehearsal.  What an exhilarating experience for all their hard work to culminate on the auditorium stage.  Bravo!  You your students and their parents should be very proud!    Thank you so much for your dedication to your students and endless enthusiasm and passion for your work!

You asked questions regarding acting choices and other students worked on critiquing the presentation.  The suggestions by the other students were thoughtful and targeted to make corrections in the presentations.  The presenting students appreciated and incorporated the feedback into the presentations.  It is a pleasure to observe the students in your class thank you.
0842388,2015,745181,2015-05-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. McEneny    I would like to thank you for the opportunity to visit your drama class. Truly you have developed the drama department at MS 51 that is simply second to none. Your dedication and commitment to your craft is amazing. I also enjoyed being part of your class during our talent professional development Mondays.     Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus
0842388,2016,846711,2015-12-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. McEneny  It was a pleasure to visit your 6T2 drama class during their rehearsal/reading of the play "Maddie Splinter and the Aluminum Chair Rocket Ship."  Entering your blackbox theater classroom is like entering a magical new world.  Background music lighting a few props and trees in the backdrop gave me a glimpse into what the final production will look like. As students read through the scene you offered direction in delivery of lines and blocking.  Students responded instantly to your feedback by trying the line a different way or by moving a certain way in order to tell the story best.  You welcomed students input and problem solving when you mentioned how the current puppet prop was not ideal and for everyone to come up with another idea that would represent the half-lizard baby. Sounds like another great orignial 6th grade play!   Thank you for your dedication and hard work!
0842388,2016,846815,2015-12-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. McEneny    When I came into this grade 6 Drama class the group was working on a play (written by you) and understanding how to make it " get more dramatic".    The students in the bleachers as well as the students in the practice stage area were assessing and making corrections as the work was in progress.  The growth from the first try to the second was "dramatic".  The conversations about how the scene made the audience feel (and by extension how the characters should feel and react) were spot on.  The students were challenged to "raise the stakes" in the acting and discussions occurred that allowed the students to help each other with the task.  The plays that you create for the students help them to understand a myriad of feelings and allows them the creativity to make a character come alive on the stage.  Thank you for allowing me to be  part of this process.
0842388,2016,890471,2016-01-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. McEneny    Your grade 7 class had moved to the main stage to work on the upcoming show.  You were working on the stage with a group of students on stage fighting.  You demonstrated the technique and the students then repeated the actions.  All of the students in the group then critiqued and offered suggestions to make it very realistic.  You provided a safe place for the students to learn an acting technique that could potentially (if not taught correctly) be problematic.  The students who did not have combat scenes were working together with scripts to "hash out" the interactions among characters as well as work on the accents that were required for the script.  This lesson was great to watch and all of the students were completely involved in the play.  Thank you for allowing me to learn alongside of the grade 7 students.

You were demonstrating movements and the students were following.  Two students were working in the back and discussing the scene that they were to perform.  The students currently not on the stage were offering suggestions and asking questions.  This was a dynamic class.  Thank you for allowing me to observe this class.

Your interaction with students as you moved from table to table was thoughtful you directed the students to look again at the work they had done and then again in the mirror.  You next worked the student through the changes that needed to be made and solicited student input and questions.

Student groups created Combines using sparkles paint toys broken instruments and many other objects to create an artistic story.  Every student was self-directed and engaged in their projects; some working in groups and some independently as you walked around the room and assessed supported and assisted your student artists.  Your classroom is an amazing space for creating art.  Your knowledge of art and education provides the inspiration and motivation for your students to explore their talents and express themselves.  Thank you so much for sharing your passion for art with your students and helping them grow as artists over three years!
0843951,2015,693274,2015-04-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Students entered the room and immediately began to work on labeling and mounting artwork for the upcoming show.  Mr. Hornberger then asked the class to work together to hang artwork in the "salon style".  The students left the classroom with the teacher to work on the school-wide installation of the artwork.  The students chose the layout and the pieces to be hung.  The net result was every stairway hallway and door covered with student art for a permanent exhibit.    Mr. Hornberger   I really enjoyed the explanation of how the art was to be hung and the fact that you allowed the students to control by consensus how each space would look.  The students not only had ownership of the individual pieces that they created but of the studio within the school that would showcase the art for a long time to come.  Thank you.
0843951,2016,824310,2015-11-25 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Hornberger    Your classroom/studio is filled with beautiful examples of student work.  You greeted the students in the hallway and explained the goal for the class.  The students moved to retrieve the art work that they had started and then to the tables.  The students worked quickly to organize the tables and start the corrections and additions to the individual work.  The conversations among the students were respectful and helpful to each other.  You monitored the work and helped when the students had reached a stopping point.    Please continue to work with the students to increase their ownership of the learning process.

Each group of students was viewing the model from a different perspective.  You demonstrated how to use a pencil to measure the proportions and then inch by inch draw the figure on the paper.  The students were assisting and editing each other while you moved to each table group (multiple times).T:"...are we on the 7th inch?...this is where you should stop..."S:"...4th inch..."T:"...problem...elbow...wrist...hand...hand half way between..."T:"...it is not about what you feel...ok now I want to see everybody remeasure...shoes...break down to simple shape..."  You also used a skull to help the students visualize how the shape of the head should look (curves etc.).    This lesson was very informative and the students were working at his/her own pace and all students were engaged in the lesson.    Thank you for asking me to come into the class.
0843951,2016,912221,2016-02-25 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Hornberger  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade art class. Students were engaged in creating aboriginal art using symbols or dots and paint created out of a few basic colors.  Each piece was unique; some were creating nature scences city scapes and abstract dreamy scenes.  Students explained that some of their challenges were creating specific colors keeping the symbols consistent and planning out the scope of the art on their paper.  Although each piece was unique students were helping each other create colors provide a critical eye and make suggestions.  Each piece was beautiful interpretive and thought provoking.  Thank you so much for your dedication to your students and the development of your accelerated and sequential curriculum.

The students were working on individual projects yet they were helping and editing each other.  The creativity in the room was wonderful and you were working with individual students as you monitored and checked in with the class.  I admire your talent and how you can make the students realize his/her own vision for a project.  The students enjoy the work and it shows in the quality and all of the awards that they and by extension you have won this year.  Thank you for inviting me into this class.

You reminded the students "...the next challenge would be to use multiple colors...remember hair...dark and lights..." as they were working and had questions about the composition of the drawing.  The students were giving positive suggestions to each other and the room had a great "feeling".  The students possessed a varying degree of "talent" but all of the students were trying to work on the skill you were addressing concerns and providing next steps and the students themselves were able to identify where he/she should make corrections.  Thank you for allowing me to watch these budding artists.

The students had 5 different maps available for the groups with additional maps hanging in the room.  The Essential Questions was displayed for student reference and a rubric for understanding the maps was also displayed.  I am grateful that you "WOW" your colleagues on a regular basis and that one came into this lesson.  In our conversation later in the day it was quite interesting to find out that some students made connections with Latin roots to figure out word meanings.  I also appreciated your explaining how the groups were formed and work together.  Thank you for all you have done to assist in the continuing professional development within the Social Studies Department.

The following are a couple of questions to think about.    What criteria do you use for assessing the students' work?  How do your students know the assessment criteria?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0847477,2015,663438,2015-03-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Feldman  It was a pleasure to visit your lesson on immigration and industrialization with class 802. Students met the Learning Target (I can describe why people emigrate and the problems they face as new immigrants) by reading narratives from four immigrant scenarios from four different countries and discussing the 'push and pull' factors their jobs and wages and the challenges they faced in American.  Students worked in discussion groups of four to complete the readings discuss their scenarios and complete a graphic organizer "Comparing Immigrant Experiences for Jewish Italian Chinese and Mexican immigrants.  You visited each group and asked probing critical thinking questions to help students connect the scenarios with the greater issues within the Era of Industrialization.  Students responded with "technology impacted the types of jobs immigrants had and the amount of money they were paid." "Farming required technical training physical work and skills." "Factory work required less skill run by monopolies thus less pay."  Students also discussed the push/pull factors and the dreams of immigrants versus the harsh reality of the immigrant lives including the journey religious and racial persecution and long working hours for low pay.    In the end students were asked to continue to work in groups to discuss and answer 6 questions to connect and think more deeply about how the lives of the immigrants played an important role in the Industrialization of America.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!

You set up several stations for students to read and look at an artifact and discuss inferences in their groups.  I heard students discussing how Europe must have been a dangerous place based on the picture they observed and the writing in the document.  I watched students look back into their notes to fact check and help them make sense of the artifact.    Next Steps:  Your students were working at a very high cognitive level. If you are going to spend any amount of time reviewing what you did the day before ask a student to give you the summary instead of you telling them.  I always want to see students working harding than the teachers!  Thank you for your thoughful planning and for bringing such a rigorous curriculum to life for your students every day!

This target was on the board and the students had a document reading to facilitate a deep dive into the laws of New Spain.  After the initial review and a mini-lesson the students were working together in groups to gather evidence to support the analysis of the laws.  You moved to each group to "check in" and the students were challenged to cite evidence both by you as well as the other students in the group.  This lesson was part of the unit on the colonization of the New World.  You have taught the students to work as independent learners (rubric) as well as a part of the group.  You made sure that each group had a representation in the "share" and called on virtually all of the students.  Thank you for a well-planned interesting lesson.

The learning target was "I can draw conclusions about ESP development in the West".  You were moving to each group to "check in" and discuss the opinions that were being expressed by the students.  You consistently asked for evidence and additional explanation.  You explained that the groups today were formed using the data that was collected during the last project.  You stopped the class to check in and share out while the students were still working with the graphic organizer (very interesting ideas that made it to the oddities column) and drawing conclusions about each group.    Thank you for inviting me in to participate in this group project.

Rockefeller was a a captain of industry or a robber baron.      The students reviewed the debate rules and divided into the predetermined groups.  The students presented opening statements and the debate began.  The students were well researched and prepared.  They questioned the sources and answered point by point.  The students were attentive to each other and the ultimate goal was to prove the position through evidence and thoughtful argument.  Thank you for inviting me into this debate it was fascinating.
0847477,2017,1089622,2016-11-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Feldman  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade social studies class as they celebrated the completion of their early American study and projects on people from the Great Plains Eastern Woodlands Southeast etc.  Students had researched ceremonies housing government and had a choice to research other topics as well such as food or transportation of that culture.  The final projects included beautiful drawings pictures and detailed information about these people and their culture including how they interacted with their environment and how artifacts gave clues to their story. The lesson's activity held students accountable by asking them to read assess and compare the research and to add new details to their graphic organizers.  I observed students reading writing in their notebook organizers and peer and self-assessing the projects at every table.  Next Steps:  Providing students choice on what they researched allowed students to be curious and ask their own questions pushing them to think critically about the cultures the people and the environment.  The more we allow students to read and ask their own questions the more we will push their critical thinking skills.  Thank you for their hard work and dedication to your students!

The students worked in groups and planned for the scenes.  The guiding questions were appropriate and the responses were given.  The students didn't expand on responses to the questions.  The listing of the new Spanish vocabulary by each group was a great idea.

Students were engaged in writing the script for their restaurant skit.  Having been on a field trip to a restaurant they had an opportunity to practice first hand and understand how to recreate a scene in a restaurant.  Your rubric was detailed and very clear.  You and the students referenced it during the lesson to stay in line with the instructional outcomes.  You conferenced with each group to check for understanding and guide them through the writing process.  You also provided a calendar of due dates.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!

The students worked together and you moved from group to group to check in and ask questions.  The class was working in Spanish and the students were working on a variety of levels students were using dictionaries translators and notebooks for clarification.  You collected the first draft.  There was not a rubric posted so I was unsure about the assessment criteria.    Please have rubrics available for students to refer to while assignments are being completed.

I look forward to visiting again.  I would like to take a closer look at the following:    How do you use discussions to increase student participation and engagement?  How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?    Thank you     Mr. G Stanislaus
0863440,2015,694665,2015-04-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Brown-Arroyo  It was a pleasure to watch your Spanish lesson with class 811!  Students eagerly answered your daily questions about date and weather speaking only in Spanish.  You quickly began your lesson on how to describe one's location using sentence starters and modeling.  You asked students to add-on to your basic question and students challenged themselves by using phrases such as "sitting besides" "sitting across from" and by using their dictionaries and notes from their notebooks.  You also required them to translate each other's responses.  You had the Conversation project rubric on the screen and on each table as you led the lesson into the activity which required students to continue to work in their groups on creating a conversation about friends traveling on a trip.  Details of the conversation included the country they are traveling to getting around the airport and speaking to airport/airplane staff. Students worked cooperatively writing dialogue discussing and creating scenarios about traveling with their friends or family while you visited and assessed each group.  Thank you so much for your dedication to your students and all your efforts!

The students were working in pairs and you were moving to each group to monitor the student work.  You asked the students to come together and you worked with them to create a list of the adjectives.  You had them repeat the pronunciation and created a chart for the students to copy.  You then moved to a picture activity  (in Spanish) which required the students to form sentences in response to the questions asked in Spanish.    Wondering:  Since this is an ICT class how is the work differentiated to the various learners?

If you look at the Danielson Rubric to go from Effective to Highly Effective in the components "Using questioning and discussion techniques" and "Using assessment in instruction" the difference is teacher directed vs. student directed.  For example "students initiate higher order thinking" and "students have helped establish evaluation criteria." If either of these are components that you would like to focus on I'd be happy to support you with them.    I look forward to visiting again.    Marcy

It is evident that you plan your lessons with the middle school student in mind- the activities vary and are engaging.    Thank you    Marcy Sterlis
0863440,2016,962441,2016-04-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Brown- Arroyo     You provide your students with a classroom environment that is conducive to learning and it is always evident that you know how middle school students learn best.    Domain 3 of the Danielson rubric (3b. 3c 3d) under "Highly Effective" has indicators that focus on students leading or taking initiative. For example 3b. "Students extend the discussion enriching..." and 3c. "Students take initiative to improve the lesson by modifying it..." You have such a great rapport with your students and if you are interested in exploring how the activities today could have included more "student ownership" of them I'd be happy to discuss with you.    Sincerely    Marcy
0863440,2016,967198,2016-04-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Brown-Arroyo  It was a pleasure to visit your Spanish Language lesson with class 809.  Students were studying a unit on airports and travel and had already researched vocabulary and phrases that are used in airport travel.  The lesson began with a fun review having students act as 'professor' showing pictures on the screen and asking students to name repeat and add synonyms in Spanish. Students had an opportunity to connect the vocabulary words to a visual and then say them aloud.  You introduced transitional words to improve the flow of their story writing.  Then in groups students created a timeline of pictures to tell their travel story.  They wrote several sentences making sure to connect each with transitional words. Students worked collaboratively to create their story and used their vocabulary sheets and phrase lists as a guide.    Highlights:  The activity was creative and fun while demanding that students write a story together using proper vocabulary and conjugation as well as connecting sentences with transitional words.  They practiced speaking and writing thoughout the exercise.  Wonderings:  How will students share their stories?  I see another opportunity for creativity by having groups read or act out their stories!    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

The evidence is in the way they speak to you and to each other.  In addition you have set a standard and a culture for learning in your classroom. There is an expectation of high-quality work on the part of your students.    Growth:  Organizing Physical space: Although your classroom is safe with equal access to learning activities there wasn't any use of technology during the lesson.Perhaps we can discuss the use of an overhead projector and an elmo which would enable you to increase the instructional time by not having to recreate the charts in each class.It will also allow you the opportunity to share work done by the different groups to the entire class in real time.     Using questioning and discussion techniques: Please take a look at the Danielson 2013 Rubric 3b. Under Highly Effective and you will see that with small adjustments your class will be operating at this level. It is these High-quality questions that encourage students to make connections among concepts or events previously believed to be unrelated and to help them arrive at new understandings of complex material.    Next Steps:  Please feel free to contact me to discuss the above.  I will check in with you in two weeks. Nov. 14 2013

You have shown that an experienced teacher is able to make both minor and major adjustments to a lesson.This being done in response to the students questions and your determination to ensure that the students understand the work at hand.    Next Steps:    Knowing that questioning and discussion techniques will be a focus for our science dept I would like to know if you develop different level questions during the lesson planning. Is this done in anticipation of the students of that particular class.     I will come to visit your class during the week of Jan. 6th     Thank You for all that you are doing for your students.

Students were engaged in creating a scientific "Family Portrait" by creating pedigrees to show inherited traits complete with designing alleles punnet squares and flow chart.  The flow charts showed how a physical and a sexual trait in the genes would be 'passed on' over 3 generations based on their punnet square percentage calculations. Some students added more than one physical trait (curly hair and eye color) while others introduced complicated variables such as adoption!  Students were highly engaged in the conversations around designing the traits punnet square calculations creating each generation based on this work as well as beatiful art work in creating what the offspring would look like in the family tree.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

Students were able to tell me what they were working on and why they were learning this topic in math.  They started with a Khan Academy video and questionnaire and had gathered pages of research and a data sheet before they began their cartograms. Students were working on various parts of the project yet supporting one another in discussion of the questions and creation of the cartograms.  Students were also observed using their phones responsibly which speaks volumes to how students respect your class rules.    Highlights:  It was exciting to see this lesson in math not just because it is so relevant before election day but also how it compliments social studies class.  Students explained to me the importance of understanding the electoral college before this year's election.  Students worked cooperatively in all aspects of the group work.  Wonderings:  Were students grouped strategically for learning?  How was this lesson differentiated?  How have you been tracking their progress during this project?    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!  This project is truly worth the time!

Students were actively engaged in self-assessment reviewing a variety of problems.  Problems varied from practice to challenge and you ensured students that you would be teaching into the more challenging questions.  You proceeded to reteach and build a foundation for the new material and provide group practice problems at all levels.  Students clearly felt comfortable to take risks offer their strategies ask for help and support one another in the classroom.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work in readying these students for the new Common Core Regents!

The demonstration you started the lesson with was fun.  The students were engaged with the line of sight and estimating height and distance.  They were able to relate it to "real world" applications and how it was used in a historical context (sailors etc.).  The students were comfortable working together to solve problems and taking risks in answering questions that were posed about complex mathematical concepts.  You are doing great work with the Advanced Algebra course and I know that the students will have great success on the Regents exam.

How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0865094,2016,868684,2016-01-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Gordon    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. You truly have set a tone that supports a high level learning  environment.  On my next visit I will focus on the questioning and discussion techniques.Below please find a few questions to consider.    What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?  How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?  In your lesson how do you group your students and why?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0865094,2016,893449,2016-02-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Gordon  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade Integrated Algebra class.  Students were checking their homework when I entered the room and you allowed them to ask questions on the most challenging problems.  You then reviewed a long series of do now problems and students presented their answers to the class.  You and the students asked clarifying questions or challenged their answers.  Students seemed comfortable taking risks on even the most difficult problems because you strategically used their mistakes to teach another point and never made them feel bad.  Students were also comfortable asking each other questions directly keeping the discussion going while problem solving together.  Your classroom felt more like a college course than a middle school class!  Please continue to share your best practices with your math colleagues!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0865094,2016,955759,2016-03-31 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. C. Gordon    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. You have established an environment that promotes independence and a positive learning experience.

0865356,2014,136427,2014-02-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,7,Formal Observation Cycle,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Next Steps:  -(1b)When planning a lesson make more explicit your grouping of students and knowledge of students.  Why were certain students grouped with others?  How did your knowledge of your students inform your lesson plan handouts scaffolds?  -(3c)While most students were intellectually engaged in the lesson alternate strategies or scaffolds may be needed for those who are easily distracted or having trouble with the content.  Consider grouping graphic organizers or small group facilitation for those students.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0865356,2014,304570,2014-05-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Galang  This was a great lesson for an 8th period class after a morning of testing!  Students were able to move around express emotions through their body language while thinking critically about their character's emotions in Romeo and Juliet.  Students were thoughtful and creative in striking a pose for emotions such as confusion betrayal and love which they will apply to their scenes.    Thank you for your dedication and hard work!
0865356,2014,362892,2014-05-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Galang  The trip you are planning to the Brooklyn Navy Yard sounds wonderful and truly appropriate before Memorial Day weekend!  The steps you took to orient your class to the experience was deliberate and allowed students to think critically about what they would be seeing and what questions they would like to ask.  You set them up to be excited to learn from the tour as well as their own inquiries.  Hope you have a great visit!
0865356,2014,408303,2014-06-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Daer Ms. Galang  It was a pleasure to watch your students present their Book Club projects today.  The presentation was easy to follow as students noted summary of the book themes they discovered and new words.  Peers listened made connections and asked questions in the end.  It was all very engaging even though the library is not your normal setting which is a testament to your routines and class culture.  Next Steps:  Consider asking peers to critique presentations based on the rubric in addition to making connections and asking questions.  Presenters may also have an opportunity to self-assess using the rubric.  Thank you for all your excellent work and dedication to your students!
0865356,2015,596464,2015-01-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Denise  Thanks so much for opening your room to our visitng teachers from Newark.  I enjoyed your class today as students were engaged in meaningful reading or writing work based on their choice and need.  In the last 20 minutes of class students could continue writing their picture books conference with you or set reading goals in terms of volume and thinking work as they engaged in independent reading.  Students wrote goals in their notebooks before they began to read ranging from volume goals to questions predictions and/or vocabulary words they wanted to define.  Allowing students choice increases engagement and allows you time to conference with students who need more support. Your room's walls are covered in reading reminders rituals and celebrations including ELA blog posts and award-winning-readers.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0865356,2015,639839,2015-03-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Galang    Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your Haiku lesson.  The students were engaged and really extended the thoughts of student who spoke before them.  This added to the understanding by all of the students.  It was very interesting to see the students work with a poem that followed a specific form in the native language but looked different when translated.  When the groups focused on specific examples they were able to share many ideas and noted very specific imagery  The conversations were deep and the students all participated and referenced prior student's answers when they presented his/her idea.    This lesson was well prepared fully engaged the students and challenged what the students thought about Haiku and how it could work when translated.
0865356,2015,634388,2015-03-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Galang    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. You have moved beyond raising great students to raising great leaders. Just a few questions to think about.    What are the criteria used for assessing the student's work?   How do the students know the assessment criteria?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0865356,2015,706424,2015-05-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Denise  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade ELA class as they interpreted scene 5 from Romeo and Juliet.  Students have been reading studying and investigating the text as well as viewing movie scenes from Romeo and Juliet leading up to this lesson.  Students used a rubric and organizer to practice their interpretation to deepen their understanding of this important scene.  Students were required to write a paraphrase of each line in the scene to give evidence of their understanding.  Prior to this lesson they were also required to describe each character and give textual evidence to support their descriptions.  Students were assessed (self peer and teacher) on their investigation body language facial expressions words and articulation stage costumes and prompts and finally their practice and performance.  You assessed each group and gave feedback as needed.  Students' performances were interpretive and entertaining with many students using body language learned from watching the movie as well as from the meaning they derived from the text.  Please share your best practices with your colleagues!  Thank you for your consistent hard work and dedication to your students.
0865356,2016,871325,2016-01-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,The class was engaged in writing/peer editing poetry about New Year (inspired in part by resolutions).    The students were working together to edit the poetry and give each other feedback and suggestions.  The teacher was conferencing with individual students.  The students had rubrics and were targeted in the editing (S: I like the last part S2:  Does it fit the poem S1:  I read it 4 times S2:  I think if you changed...flows better...it's tough to change...let's try...).    This class was a model for both independent and group work.

Truly your students are benefiting from your teaching and high standards you set for them. Below are a few questions to consider moving forward.    How do you provide students with feedback on their progress?  How do you know when all students met the learning outcome?  Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
0865356,2016,895015,2016-02-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Galang  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade ELA class as they were analyzing 'conclusion paragraphs' of essays to identify the author's craft moves and key ingredients of a powerful conclusion to a persuasive essay.  Students worked together and individually and shared their thinking with the whole class.  You facilitated the discussion and helped students highlight the most important aspects of an excellent conclusion paragraph.  The handout and graphic organizer helped students organize their thinking as they analyzed the writing and started to think about how they would incorporate these craft moves into their own essay.   I look forward to reading their essays!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0865356,2016,986387,2016-05-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Galang    Thank you for the invitation to observe your 8th grade writing class. As I mentioned I was very impressed with the discussions (small groups and whole class) and the techniques students uncovered from their mentor texts. The information you shared about the unit was helpful for me to better understand the writing piece they were working on and I would love the opportunity to read some when they are finished!     Sincerely    Marcy

Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0865828,2014,173466,2014-02-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,Ms. Maier your classroom is bustling with ideas and student driven work.  I am amazed at the level of conversations between many of the students.
0865828,2014,474294,2014-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,Students were collecting research for a debate.  The students chose the groups and the position.  The teacher and students were actively working together to focus the information into a well developed argument.
0865828,2014,474244,2014-06-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The "big idea" of tis unit was American Expansionism.  The students were very engaged in a discussion about imperialism and whether it was right for America.  The students were evaluating each others paragraphs and giving feedback.  This lesson was clear well organized interesting and required students to defend arguments.
0865828,2014,474266,2014-06-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,Students were reviewing primary source documents of Normandy.  The students were asked to discuss the events of the day and a conversation ensued about how the young soldiers would feel on that day.  The acting out of the invasion was inspired.

This ICT class has 33 students a push-in teacher an ICT co-teacher and a para in the same room there are many different moving parts operating together.  The ability of the co-teachers to work together seamlessly shows the amount of time they spend planning together.    Please continue to work with the other adults in the room and "turn-key" your success to the other G.E. teachers who are working with ICT classes.
0865828,2015,610026,2015-02-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Sharon  It was a pleasure to visit your social studies class with 809 this morning.  Students had generated dozens of thoughtful questions about the job of a cowboy in the 1800's researched them for HW and created fun and artistic job postings containing the content details of what the position would entail.  You had a rubric for the project as well as a rubric for the celebration/peer assessment/vote that students used this morning for the 'best' advertisements.    You have created an engaging classroom environment that makes learning fun. Your room is chock full of learning tools (classroom library timelines instructional charts primary sources historical photographs rubrics and class structures).  You have a wonderful rapport with your 8th graders using humor engaging activities and discussion to motivate student learning breed independent thinking as well as collaboration.  Thank you for your dedication to your students your craft and your colleagues.  The workshop you co-conducted last Monday allowed you to share your highly effective teaching strategies and tools with your colleagues and was well received.  Much appreciated!
0865828,2015,725921,2015-05-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Maier    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Your class and the movement of the lesson was nothing short of a work of art. When students are exposed to this high a level of instruction they have no choice but to reach their full potential. I also realize that this was the first lesson in a series of lessons to come. I look forward to visiting again to see :    How you continue to ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  and How both you and your co teacher continue to use discussion among students? Why?    Thank you    Mr. Stanislaus
0865828,2016,862416,2015-12-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,When I entered the room you were working with students on d document analysis of a political cartoon. After the initial mini-lesson you moved to the group of students who had self-assessed as understanding the work. Your co-teacher moved to the struggling group and both of you covered the room seamlessly checking in with all of the groups. The students color coded sections of the  work to identify where he/she thought help was needed and the students worked together to complete the  assignment.  You used a timer to keep the students on track.  Thank you for co-creating the presentation for the staff on "touchy topics". Your ability to negotiate the world of issues for the students (without making anyone uncomfortable) and translating it into a teaching tool for your fellow teachers was wonderful.  It is a pleasure to visit your room thank you.
0865828,2016,903719,2016-02-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Maier    Thank you for inviting me into "Cowboy Fun Day".  You and Mr. Levinson make a wonderful team.  I am very impressed with the tandem teaching and the preparation that the two of you do for the ICT classes.  The students were grouped together to look at the ads that they had created and to discuss the life of a cowboy.  You had the students do a "gallery walk" that was organized and the rubric for the project was posted on the board.  The students were able to go to the "cookie" and have a "taste of the west".    This lesson was very engaging to the students and they participated fully.  It was great to see the ICT students take ownership of the learning and to see the teachers support it.    Please invite others into your room to see the work that you are doing in the ICT class.
0865828,2016,979695,2016-04-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Maier  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade social studies class as they were annotating difficult text on Corporations and writing one-long sentence with their new found vocabulary knowledge.  Their task involved working in groups to create a sentence using as many of these new words as grammatically possible!  Students were motivated by the contest-atmosphere as they collaborated with their peers to create complex sentences that would meet the criteria (no run-ons grammatically correct proper use). Students assessed one another within their groups as they were creating the sentences and then again during the competition when they read their sentences aloud choosing the ultimate winner.    Students had a context of industrialization in 'old' NYC having looked around the neighborhood (for homework) and at photos for evidence in buildings transportation and names of places that represent old industry.  This added to the content of their conversations as they talked about corporations and stocks in today's lesson.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0882648,2014,26293,2013-10-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,STRENGTHS:  Throughout the lesson through the para-professionals and your own observations you continued to adjust your instruction in response to evidence of student understanding. This was evidenced by the attention given to each student as they worked.     It is commendable how you were able to continually be aware of student conduct. This was evident by the way you worked with the student being resistant to doing the assignment and the para-professional. Together you were able to move the student beyond the challenges of the work at hand.     GROWTH:    Questioning and discussion techniques:    Questioning is used to deepen student understanding. It is important that the teacher creates a genuine discussion among students providing adequate time for students to respond and stepping aside when doing so is appropriate.It is here where the teacher should employ a range of strategies to ensure that most students are heard.     Next Steps:    Over the next two weeks take the opportunity to continue to read the Danielson 2013 Rubric 3(b) and look for ways to incorporate those strategies in your lesson. I will forward you the link to the Learning Opportunities videos on questioning that lead to high level thinking and discourse.

They were so open toshare their knowledge with me and are completely engaged in the unit on natural resources.  You provided various texts handouts exit slips and lesson extensions where students could work at their own pace.  Students had opportunities to read and write claims about the article as you led the discussion and reviewed the content with video/visual and NewsELA texts.  Your handouts were clear and simple yet required critical thinking and standards-based reading and writing work.    Next Steps:  You have cultivated an amazing learning environment in your room where students are kind and respectful of all learners and comfortable to take risks.  Consider a couple minutes of collaborative partner or group discussion (turn and talk) to help students think aloud about their claims before they write.  Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to your students.

You continue to do such great work with all of your students. You incorporate many different ways of teaching the lessons. Students have many entry points into the lesson. You used video presentations and conversations to present the learning targets to your students.     In your lesson how do you group your students and why?  When grouping students how does that improve the learning?    All for your students seemed genuinely excited throughout the lesson.    Thank you  Mr. Gregory Stanislaus

In our post-observation debrief you shared the rubrics that you have been using this school year including the one that students will be using next. It looks great and I'll be interested in seeing how they score themselves versus the score that you give them.    Sincerely    Marcy Sterlis
0882648,2016,946587,2016-03-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Porcelan  It was a pleasure to visit your science lesson with class 601.  During the period all students had an opportunity to verbally answer many questions around the Learning Target involving the rotating earth and revolving moon (and its phases) and the realtionship between the earht moon and sun.  Students connected these relationships to day night seasons and the data they were tracking on sunrise and sunset.  Students had extensive notes and drawings in their notebooks and knew where to find information when discussing these concepts. They created 2 models using their bodies and drawings to display the phases of the moon and the revolving moon and rotating earth. You also provided a 2-minute clip on Apollo 17 to provide another visual to understand gravity on the moon.    Highlights:  Students were extremely organized and could verbally articulate an incredible amount of accurate information about the content in this unit.  Students' notebooks were filled with notes writing and drawings of science content.  All students had a voice in the discussion and could work at their own pace.   Wonderings:  With all this new found knowledge it would be great to see these students tackle higher order critical thinking questions in this topic by discussing their ideas in small groups or partnerships and then writing their responses independently.  You have a wonderful rapport with your lovely group of learners!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0882648,2016,1021832,2016-05-25 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Porcelan  Thank you for allowing me to observe your 12:1:1 class during the Social Studies lesson.  When I entered the room the students were already working on the unit.  You provided me with an extensive outline for the unit (which has/will last for a number of days) that outlines the connections with writing reading and science (connected by water).  The students were required to support ideas with evidence and were anxious to be heard.  You allowed each student to speak and supported that student.  The students were placed in groups for an activity that required them to access prior knowledge and use text to create cards for a game that they would play later.  The game reinforced the major themes of the unit and was completed after I left the room.  It was great to see the students be able to apply the ideas of Rome to current politics and be able to name and identify the leaders of the various parts of government (mayor DiBlasio etc.) today.    Thank you for allowing me to see a wonderful lesson in this Special Education classroom.
0886503,2015,652288,2015-03-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Levy  It was a pleasure to visit your ESL class on Academic Vocabulary.  Students studied the word 'essential' and the Academic Vocabulary resource book allowed them to practice defining speaking writing and using the word in a paragraph.  You scaffolded the work with practice sentences and verbal examples and supported their grammar parts of speech and other writing mechanics.  Students were entirely engaged as they worked independently with partners and shared with the group.  You conferred with each student to check for understanding.  You applied the learning target to the second activity when they began a state practice test short constructed response exercise and tried to use the word 'essential' in the response.    Thank you for your dedication to your students!
0886503,2015,740170,2015-05-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Levy  It was a pleasure to visit your ESL class and watch you facilitate a Memorial Day lesson through a reading activity.  Students were partnered and one read a paragraph about Memorial day to the other while the listening partner had to fill in the blanks of the text by listening to the reader.  Then they switched roles with another reading.  After the activity students discussed the challenges of listening to a reader while writing the missing words.  You then reviewed relevant vocabulary.    Next Steps:  To increase engagement post NYSESLAT consider mixing up the partnerships starting a creative long term project they can add to each week or forming book clubs.  Let me know if you need more resources as we plan for next year.  Thanks for your dedication and hard work!
0886503,2015,747239,2015-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Levy    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom in the computer lab. You are building the confidence of the students you work with by giving them tools for success in the future. Please think about the following questions.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  What was the criteria for assessing the students' work?  How did you know that all students met the learning outcome?    Thank you    Mr. Stanislaus
0886503,2015,768654,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Levy    Thank you for allowing me to observe your small (5 students) group in room 323.  You had one student working on the computer with an assignment while the others were working to edit a written piece to use past tense verbs.  The students were using word lists to assist in the editing process and you were assessing each student as they were working through the process.      Wondering:  Is the written piece connected to what the students are studying in the Social Studies class?  Could were make connections to the work that is being done in the classroom when students are part of the ESL pull-out group?
0886503,2016,813544,2015-11-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Thank you for inviting me into your classroom; I enjoyed observing your students working together and  finding the correct answers using strategies that you have taught them.      Also thank you for sending me the lesson and the hand-out; your advanced preparation led to a well managed and structured learning environment. As I was reviewing the unit plan and considering your class composition I thought that the Essential Question (in this case "How do we use grammar and parts of speech as well as context to figure out new vocabulary words?") might be an area to consider focusing on so that throughout the unit students are challenged and engaged in inquiry based  activities. If you would like to delve into Essential Questions further I'd be happy to assist.    Sincerely    Marcy
0886503,2016,879376,2016-01-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Levy  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade ESL class as your students were studying Myan ruins/Mexican Pyramids.  You warmed them up to the topic by showing them a brief video about the Lost City in Mexico and then reintroducing the text from the packet.  You shared the reading with students as they looked at the text you read aloud.  Students shared stories as they made connections to other texts and films.  You called on students randomly as you worked through the packet of different types of questions reminding them to find the text evidence to support their answers.  Next Steps:  In order to get students to work more collaboratively and talking in partnerships about the topic questions consider asking a question giving partners a couple minutes to find the answer - with text evidence - and then sharing out to the group. They can really benefit from using their class time to practice these steps as they need these skills in all their subject areas.  While it is important for ENL students to hear your voice and pronunciation of words more of the time can be used for them to think speak and write.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0886503,2016,955655,2016-03-31 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Levy    Thank you for allowing me to visit your classroom. You have allowed your students to become involved in learning German. The class environment that i observed was one that supported the learning in your class.     How do you use discussion among students? Why?  How do you check for student understanding throughout the lesson?  How do the activities and assignments promote student thinking?  How do you structure the lesson so that students were engaged throughout the lesson?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stabislaus
0886503,2016,1001029,2016-05-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Levy     Mr. Levy thank you for allowing me to visit with you class. You are preparing your students with the necessary skills to be successful in school. Please see the questions below.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?  How do you use discussion among students?Why?  How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?    Thank you   Mr. G. Stanislaus

A place where all students can challenge their thinking in many ways. The expectations for learning and achieving are clear for all students.     Next Steps:    As a department the focus in terms of questioning and discussion techniques is to use a variety or series of questions or prompts to challenge students cognitively advance high-level thinking and discourse and promote metacognition.     Also I would like to suggest that after each student is given the chance to come up to explain his/her answer you challenge them to review the grading rubric and say what they would give themselves. This rubric could be given to them or hanging in the room.    Thank You so much for the opportunity to visit your classroom.
0888067,2014,80152,2013-12-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Next Steps:  How are you tracking the progress of your learners?  I would love to better understand your system for tracking progress and how you are working with students at each level to make progress as we approach this next half of the year.  Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to your students!

You have taken lots of time in these meetings and organizing math curriculum.  During your November parent-teacher conferences and your website you communicate clearly and thoroughly with your parent population.  You maintain accurate records know your students well and seek resources to support them.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!

I will come in on Friday may 30 2014.     Looking at 1c. Setting Instructional Outcomes.     How do you identify instructional outcomes that are Common Core-aligned and as appropriate include career development and occupational standards vocational skills and functional learning outcomes?    Thank You

Mr. Osborne    I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for all that you have done to ensure a positive learning experience for all of your students. In addition you have taken on many of the responsibilities for the math department to support all of the students learning experience.     Thank you.

As we move forward i will visit your class again and focus on assessment  and questioning/discussion techniques.     Thank you     Mr. G Stanislaus
0888067,2015,638655,2015-03-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Osborne  It was a pleasure to visit your math class with 604.  As a class you were working on Writing Inequalities from Context Problems.  Students were working on the problems and sharing their ideas as you facilitated the sharing of the solutions to each problem.  With each question you asked students to find the variable quantity assign a letter and then solve for the inequality.  The problems were very challenging but students took risks in sharing their methods to finding solutions.  There was a high level of discourse as students explained their thinking and solutions to the class.    Next Steps:  Consider allowing students time in each lesson to talk with one another and problem solve in smaller groups so that those students who don't like to share with the whole group have a chance to engage and think aloud with a classmate.  Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to your students and colleagues.
0888067,2015,768712,2015-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Osborne    This class was a pleasure to view.  The students were working with you to review the work that had been done prior to the lesson before you began a new section.  The students were eager to share the answers that they had found.  Thank you.    Next steps;    Please consider allowing the students a few moments to share in the groups before you move to the whole group.  This might help the students clarify the thinking and prepare the questions that they had before the entire group starts to work together.
0888067,2015,771361,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Osborne    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom Throughout this entire you have continued to demonstrate dedication and commitment to all of your students. It is clear that you understand and know the learning styles of your students. I look forward to working with you in the upcoming year. Have a great summer!    Thank you    M. G Stanislaus

As they used the distributive property to solve a problem you asked many questions that allowed students to explain their work out loud to the class.  The math problems were CCLS-aligned and challenged the thinking of your students.  You required students to show how they got their results and explain why it was the correct solution using the appropriate vocabulary. Students were comparing their own work with the solutions presented on the screen by you and other students.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students's progress.  They all seemed to be really enjoying themselves!
0888067,2016,887461,2016-01-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Osborne    Thank you for allowing me to visit your classroom. Your students are given the opportunity to learn in a rich environment.  Thank you for all of the work you continue to do with the math department. please review the questions below.    How do you connect pair group and class discussions to math and/or opportunities to extend thinking?  In what ways do you use questioning to successfully support students' mastery of the objective? How do you know?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
0888067,2016,992318,2016-05-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Osborne    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. You have established an environment for learning that supports all of your students. The discussions in the class and the interactions encourage students to challenge ideas and question what they do not understand.     In what ways can the use of questioning successfully support students mastery of the objective? How will you know when this happens?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0890081,2014,31724,2013-11-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The dual language program is a wonderful opportunity for the students.  You have embraced the Social Studies curriculum.  Next Steps:  Work on questioning technique.  Using fewer questions that are more rigorous will deepen the students understanding and allow them to check his/her idea against the other students in the class.  Allow for more class discussion time.  The students will learn from each other as well as from the teacher.  Pose a question allow discussion with each other use the information from the discussions to build additional questions.  Please work on the items above and I will check in with you before November 26 2013.
0890081,2014,48270,2013-11-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,In order to raise the bar on student accountability you might consider having the students take notes during the presentations.  While the students did provide feedback after each presentation perhaps using notes the feedback would help identify next steps that could be shared among students.
0890081,2014,405859,2014-05-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,Ms. deWever your communication with the Dual Language families and the resources that you have provided have started the program well.  The students were engaged in lively discussions in French and you encouraged the students to look at all sides of the questions being posed.
0890081,2014,409423,2014-06-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. deWever  It was a pleasure to watch you teach French as a second language to class 609.  You used a combination of strategies that would engage many learning styles - visual writing listening and speaking to engage your learners.  Students were very comfortable sharing their answers verbally in French and working in groups to practice verb conjugation.  Students created and deconstructed sentences as a whole class with your guidance and then independently and in groups.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication!

0890081,2015,554785,2014-12-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,This was a dual language grade 6 Social Studies class.  The entire class was taught in French.  When asked the students were able to quickly translate the task and how they were completing it.  The teacher uses her web-site to keep parents and students abreast of the lessons homework and class assignments.  The communication between teacher/parent/administration is highly effective and appreciaated by all.    Thank you for allowing me to observe a wonderful lesson. I really enjoyed the topic and appreciated the students who helped to translate for me.      Please continue to work on questioning with the grade 6 students.  While the students were working together and sharing conversations about the facts they need to have questions that deepen their understanding.  One method you might want to think about using would be to invite students to pose questions (after they discuss in the groups) about the topic to the class.  They then can answer and extend each others answers(with your feedback).  Based on the lesson today this might have allowed a connection to be made from the governmental structures of ancient Rome to current government types and the strengths and weaknesses of both.
0890081,2015,605669,2015-02-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Madame de Wever  It was such as pleasure to visit your French second language class during the 607 fashion show!  They clearly planned their presentation to include descriptions of their apparel which required group work to prepare a verbal presentation using proper vocabulary sentence structure and pronunciation.  This type of preparation for a presentation allows students to meet reading writing and speaking standards in second language.    Next Steps:  to increase engagement and critical thinking perhaps you could ask the student-audience how they would improve/correct some of the presentation mistakes before you correct the presenter.  This would allow audience members to improve their listening gain extra points (perhaps) and think more critically while they listen and learn.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your craft and students!

The students were highly engaged in the rigorous lesson you had planned helping students understand maps and using map skills.  Your questions allowed students to explore 'why' details in a map are needed and how they help the reader.  The lesson was in French as was all the student responses and conversations.  Students were asked to write speak listen and read in French throughout the lesson.    Thank you for your dedication to this program and the French curriculum you have developed in both social studies and language arts.

The students were very helpful in translating for me.  The students were working on map and chart skills in the groups.  You were moving to each group to monitor the progress.  The conversation seemed to be centered on how weather/climate affects settlement areas.    Thank you for all of the work you have done to create the Social Studies Dual Language program curriculum.  Please continue to reach out to the other Social Studies teachers as you work to complete the Middle School level work.

Students were excited to play the game and you made learning fun! You struck a nice balance with the teacher-directed activity (quick review of the homework) and then allowed students to work as teams while you facilitated.     I look forward to coming in again.

0890081,2016,842984,2015-12-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. deWever  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade French DL class.  Students were presenting their arguments about why their Greek historical figure was of greatest importance ready to argue with counter-claims against the other presenters who had the same claim about their own person of interest.  Students spoke fluently in French concistently throughout the lesson.  Students researched these historical Greeks over the past 2 weeks used multiple sources as evidence in argument.  Students in the audience graded presenters on quality of claims quality of evidence to support claims and counter-claims and quality of group work.  Students were comfortable sharing and receiving the feedback from peers and teacher.    Wonderings:  I was amazed at how students spoke French throughout the lesson and rarely slipped into English even when in conversation with peers?  How do you reinforce this in class?  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to the program and your students.
0890081,2016,872329,2016-01-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,This grade 6 class is a dual language French class.  The entirety of this Social Studies class was conducted in French.  Students provided translations when needed.  The class was working with text and pictures to study the Roman Empire.  When I entered the room they were finishing predictions based on prior knowledge as the teacher notated them on a chart.  The students then read an article and then discussed (in French) the benefits of being a part of Rome.  The students worked in pairs in larger groups and as a whole class.  The teacher then conducted a "share" and the students were required to cite evidence to support or eliminate the predictions.  The why and how do you know prompts were given for the students to explain or add to a prior students statement.  The teacher moved to each group and facilitated the conversations about the pieces of art that the students were viewing.  The students always spoke in French (except when translating for me) and worked well together.

Groups are not limited to strivers but can be created for high level students as well as they work through the various lesson activities throughout the workshops in this unit.    Thank you for your dedication to your students and your collaborative work with your grade team.

Your line of questioning helped students think through the logical and scientific challenges helping students explore definitions of truth and freedom.   Thank you for your dedication and hard work!
0891342,2014,310387,2014-05-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Rachel  Thanks for inviting me back in to see the philosophical discussions around Freedom.  Students were completely engaged in critically thinking about Freedom and had spent many class periods writing about it in their journals and in the graphic organizers.  These tools prepared them to have thoughtful high level thinking conversations about what it means to be Free which you facilitated with even more prompts.  Most impressive in these arguments were how students provided evidence to support their ideas.  You are truly preparing your 8th graders for high school!

Today I heard discussions on the theme of ethics which included student-developed questions such as "Do ethics affect your future? When is something good or bad?  Does social class affect ethics?"  You asked probing questions to faciliate the discussions and assess students.  Students tackled these big questions through discussion taking notes and challenging group mates with more questions.  Thank you for creating such a thoughtful unit that promotes critical thinking independent expression and highly functional discussion groups.

It was a pleasure to visit your writing class today as you discussed how students will teach the picture book to younger students.  Your discussion questions elicited critical thinking and further questioning by students.  Students shared their revised objectives ideas on engagement and thoughtful concerns about sharing bias and managing younger students.  You allowed students to respond to each other's questions and guided the conversation with modeling and supports to build their confidence and set clear expectations.  Thank you for your collaborative efforts and your dedication to your craft and students.

It very clear that you invest many hours in the preparation of your lessons. You are constantly building on previous lessons with a clear direction and destination for all of your students. Truly this was a wonderful experience.    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0891342,2015,742579,2015-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Rear  It was a pleasure to observe your ELA lesson with class 807.  Students were sharing their wonderings about society and politics with questions such as "Do politics define one's position in society? Who controls the balance of community? How does society influence your choices?"    In the activity you asked small groups to come together to build a tower out of marshmallows and toothpicks.  Two groups had no leader 2 groups had elected leaders and 2 groups had random leaders.  You told the leaders that they controlled all decisions and would delegate the work.  After 5 minutes you measured all the towers. The groups with leadership had significantly taller towers than the groups without leaders.    You then asked the groups to reflect in their notebooks: "one good thing about the leadership style of your group and one negative thing about your group's leadership style.  What was the most effective leadership style?  List 5 qualities of a good leader."  The questioning and critical thinking among your students was most impressive! The concepts and questions around society and leadership will make for excellent discussions in the coming weeks.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

I was really amazed at how you have developed your class of students to facilitate the lesson. You have taught them to have great confidence in their ability to think and engage in deeper conversations with each other and with you. The atmosphere was full of excitement .Have a great summer.    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0891342,2016,875172,2016-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Rear    When I entered the room the students were working in groups planning for the social action picture books.  The students had a graphic organizer and large collections of picture books to review.  The students were noticing many examples of how the illustrations were being used to move the story (S:..the narrator is grown up but the pictures are watercolor..I think..) or make the reader think about the meaning of the text.    This lesson was a planning step in the social action unit and some of the students were already sketching out the characters for the personal stories that they were creating.  Thank you for the very interesting very student centered lesson.
0891342,2016,886154,2016-01-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Rear    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. When I entered your class you had classical music playing which set a positive tone for the creative work that was being done by your students. You became more like a facilitator in the learning process. Students are truly emerging as independent learning. Please review the questions below.    How do you connect pair and class discussions to writing and/or opportunities to extend thinking?  In what ways do you use questioning successfully to support students' mastery of the objective? How do you know?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
0891342,2016,946626,2016-03-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Rear  It was a pleasure to visit your ELA lesson with class 803 as they acted their scene from Romeo and Juliet.  They were incredibly excited and prepared to perform their reading decked out in costumes and quite articulate.  The students appeared to have excellent comprehension of this difficult text as evidenced by their acting and inflection of speech.  They took many risks from costuming to pretend kissing and truly enjoyed bringing meaning to the words.  Students voted on their favorite cast and then self-assessed their improvement in comprehension from the time they began reading the scene until today.  Most students expressed a large improvement in comprehension based on this experience with the language.  Wonderings:  Was there any criteria for choosing which scene was best?  I loved them both!    Thanks for your hard work and dedication to your students (and Shakespeare!)

Your excellent planning was evident as you incorporated rigorous reading and writing strategies into your test prep unit.  Students have been reading a variety of texts and responding in a way so that you can assess and provide feedback.  You have also been planning with data from practice tests in order to meet the needs of your students.  Next Steps:  In order to allow more time for students to write and to help them start thinking about their IWP a discussion among classmates may better initiate and support the writing process than a whole group teacher led discussion.  Instead of a full mini lesson quickly remind them of the writing genres and then consider posing the question "What genre are you thinking to write in for your IWP? Turn and talk with your partner."  Student to student discussion may help students get their writing ideas flowing.  As stated in 3b we want teachers to use a variety or series of questions or prompts to challenge students cognitively advance high-level thinking and discourse and promote metacognition. We hope this helps students to formulate many questions initiate topics challenge one another’s thinking and make unsolicited contributions.   Thank you for your dedication and excellent work in ELA!

The graphic organizer was easy to use and helped students prepare drafts and use mentor texts in their independent writing.    Thank you for your dedication to your craft and to your students!
0895447,2014,335295,2014-05-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. O'Hara  I enjoyed your class on poem revision.  Students were actively engaged and thinking critically while reading each other's poems and helping to identify potential in poems and one element to revise.  At the end of the activity students appeared to be clearer on their next steps to improving their poems which are due next week.  As an addition to peer advice you provided students with a brief lesson/handout on revision tips to use over the weekend.  Thank you for exciting your young poets to produce this great work.
0895447,2014,377219,2014-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Felicia  This is such a great lesson to help students make their book talks more meaningful and what better way to critically think about them than with a fish bowl.  For 6th graders this was a brave move but in your nurturing high expectations classroom students were free to take the risk. Students comments were very insightful and created a great plan for book talks to come.  Thanks!
0895447,2014,402224,2014-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Felicia  It has been a pleasure watching your 6th graders grow as readers and writers this year!  Students were highly engaged in putting the finishing touches on their myth presentations and organizing their roles and presentations points based on the rubric/checklist you provided.  You emphasized and reminded students of group-talk rules to improve their tone and calm the presenters.  These are important skills to be used in all classes.  Thank you!
0895447,2015,595859,2015-01-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. O'Hara  It was a pleasure to visit your class today - thank you for welcoming our teacher visitors from Newark as well.  Your writing lesson allowed all students to use the rubric by scoring a former student's essay as well as their own claims to learn the nuances of the rubric and begin to revise their own work.  Students had time to take on the role of scorer and think critically about what was good about the essay as well as where it could be improved.  You highlighted how this new rubric has higher expectations as it is aligned to common core standards.    Thank you for your dedication to always improving students' writing work and contributing to the development of a school wide/grade wide argument rubric.
0895447,2015,606951,2015-02-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Felicia  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade nonfiction reading lesson. Having participated in the TC PD where the 'pictogram' strategy was introduced I saw its value first hand in your lesson.  Your high level critical thinking questions elicited thoughtful responses as students used their nonfiction text to analyze the goals and techniques used by nonfiction authors. The Scholastic magazine you used provides high interest articles in which to embed this work.  Together you analyzed techniques and goals used by these authors and then students worked together to analyze the magazine article with a choice of post-its or notebook and pictograms. The final product was thoughtful and comprehensive using text evidence in each example.  Thank you for your dedication to your students and your craft as you lead your department in this very important reading work.

Ass of your students where so engaged in the lesson. You understood the needs of your students and it was evident by the different groups you had working together.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  What criteria or tools did you use to craft questions?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0895447,2015,768705,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. O'Hara    Thank you for allowing me into your book club lesson.  The students were working hard discussing the books and you were actively monitoring the conversations.  You had strategies for a book talk listed and referred the students to the list when necessary.  When you came together for the conversation as a class the students were eager to share and did add on to prior students thoughts.  This model was working very well and the students were getting satisfaction in the work that they were doing.    Wondering:    How are you assessing the conversations?  I observed you notating as you were moving to groups but didn't notice a rubric that the students could refer to for assessment.
0895447,2016,899765,2016-02-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. O'Hara  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade ELA class as they were engaged in a shared reading; while you read they jotted their thoughts on post-its about what the symbol in the story was doing and what it represented.  Students then turned and talked to their tablemates to discuss their ideas.  You then called on students from each table to share their thoughts.  Students clearly connected the symbolism behind the cocoon opening into a butterfly to the main character learning English.  Students were also able to identify the moment in the story to the Plot Mountain (falling action).  You reminded them that they should apply this knowledge to their own writing of their memoir.  Students were able to find the symbolism in the title and when the bell rang you left them with an essential question to tie up the unit and keep them thinking until the next lesson!  Next Steps:  Looking forward to seeing how they use symbolism in their own memoirs.   Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0895447,2016,926049,2016-02-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. O'Hara    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. You Have motivated all of your students to want to reach their full potential. Your classroom environment lends for great learning.     How do you connect pair group and class discussions to writing to extend thinking?  What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus

You were using mentor texts from the TC Units of Study planning guide to support student learning.  Students read both examples of mentor text and made decisions on which text would help them improve/revise their own writing based on whether they needed action and dialogue or sensory detail.  Students discussed plans/self-assessed and then began the work of revision.  You visited groups to answer questions.  Highlights:  Student discussions were fruitful and many students made revisions that improved their writing based on what they learned from the mentor piece.    Wonderings:  As students worked in groups how did you decide who to visit for a group conference? How did your conference guide their work plan and how are you tracking this work?    Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to your students!

Please move them to citing specific evidence from each other when they add to the conversation.  This will help them move to DOK 3 (assess) and DOK 4 (Analyze/Connect).

You have a number of students who seek to participate and you also call on others who do not want his/her voice to be heard but how can we get students to be more willing to take a chance and volunteer?  Perhaps we as a department can look more closely at this during our June planning.
0897452,2014,405758,2014-05-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The video was very interesting.  The students had many questions and comments.  The notetaking was a great way to keep the students on task and prepare them for the follow-up activity.

All students had a copy of the text and the class was looking at the photograph to solicit information.  This current event topic about the destruction of archaeological sites in the Middle East was a great bridge with your study of ancient cultures.  The students were challenged to make connections to prior knowledge connection to self as well as connection to other text.  This lesson supported both the school-wide "evidence in argument" as well as the ELA reading focus.  The connections made text to self text to prior knowledge (Mesopotamia etc.) and text to text helped the students stretch the thinking.    Thank you for sharing such a wonderful lesson.  Please invite your colleagues to WOW (watch others work).  If I can assist you with this please let me know.
0897452,2015,684339,2015-04-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Kunhardt  I enjoyed visiting your 6th grade lesson on how ancient Greek culture can be inferred by reading Greek mythology (as well as explaining natural phenomenon).  As students read (shared reading) each myth and learned about each God they used a graphic organizer to make inferences about the ancient culture. You highlighted important vocabulary and context clues and held students accountable by reminding them of their responsibilities during each part of the lesson and randomly calling on students using cards. You checked for understanding by asking students questions checking homework reviewing the organizer and visiting each group during the activity.  Students discussed their creations - a God or Goddess of the modern world reinforcing the attributes of ancient Gods and furthering their understanding of this unit. You made several connections to the reading work they do in ELA and students' responses to the activity were thoughtful and engaging. Students will be writing their own myths in a culminating activity.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0897452,2015,769665,2015-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Kunhardt    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. The students in your class are given the opportunity to express and contribute to the lesson that is guided by you. Your dedication to your students has proven to prepare them for the next level of education.Consider the following questions as we prepare for a new year.    How do your students know the assessment criteria?  How do students use the assessment criteria to check their work?    Thank you     Mr. Stanislaus
0897452,2015,768359,2015-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Kunhardt    it is always a pleasure to observe your classes.  The students were working on a current events piece and they were anxious to share what they discovered.  You directed them to cite evidence and encouraged all of the students to participate.  You allowed every question (including astronaut toilets) and had the students reason out the answers.    Please invite your grade 6 colleagues into your room to observe your dynamic current events strategies.
0897452,2016,890469,2016-01-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Kunhardt    When I entered the grade 6 class the students were working with an article from scholastic magazine (and notes etc.) to prepare for a debate.  The students were able to articulate the current event unit and the rules for the debate.  The students in the first group were working to find a way to argue the counterpoint effectively (they thought taking the less accepted side would be more of a challenge).  You had the students move to various sections of the room to signify where they stood on the topic.  You also told them that they could switch groups if another student's argument swayed them.  The students were asked to cite evidence for the argument with each fact that they chose to make his/her case.  The students knew the rules for the debate and it was obvious that they had helped create the rules.    This debate took many students out of his/her comfort level as they tried to use evidence to prove a point which was counterintuitive to them.  Thank you for providing the opportunity for the grade 6 students to research and debate a controversial topic and look at all points of view.
0897452,2016,948130,2016-03-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Kunhardt    When I entered the room the students were completing a presentation.  The presentation included a verbal presentation (with a question/answer portion) a model and a written piece.  The students were well aware of the criteria (all had a copy of the rubric) and were ready to participate in the question/answer session.  When the presentation completed you moved on to a map skill which was to open the unit on Ancient China.  The students moved to work in groups to complete the map and discuss the effect that physical features had on civilizations.  You moved to each group to check in.    You are very willing to allow the grade 6 students to take ownership of his/her own learning while you facilitate the class.  I know that you have opened your room to "wow" other teachers please continue to do so.    Thank you.
0897452,2016,1003484,2016-05-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Kunhardt  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade social studies lesson on Athens Pericles and his role in forming the democracy.  After a quick review you engaged students in a shared reading from the new textbook. You asked students a variety of questions (about the pictures and primary vs. secondary resources) to orient them to the text and set them up for greater comprehension (What type of columns are on that building?  Is this text a primary or secondary source? What is the question we have about this text as we read? What makes a democracy? What are the citizens in this scene doing that is important in a democracy? Who was left out of the conversation?).  After the reading the essential question was "Who was Pericles and what advice would you give him?  What's the reform of policy to be made?"  Students worked in groups and individually to tackle this question analyze text discuss write and then share with the larger group.  Next Steps:  So that all voices are heard and engaged in the process perhaps each group could make a one minute presentation on their advice to Pericles using evidence from text or notes (also modeling the text book scene of a democracy-discussing/debating).  You could chart student ideas in support of the reform (or against) and what needs to happen to make it successful.  These ideas could lead to a social action campaign or debate and an even more clear connection to modern day politics and the American democracy.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

You provided the Junior Scholastic magazine and a worksheet for the students to use.  The students were working in groups discussing articles that they chose to focus on and you worked with the groups as a check-in.  You focused on the first 2 questions as an example of what the responses were expected to be and you always asked the students to elaborate.  You made connections to the topic being studied in class (ancient Greece) and the students had a discussion of the Bajau Laut culture.  The students were offered a wide range of choices in topics and they enjoyed looking at the various articles together.  Thank you for an interesting current events lesson.
0903338,2014,24258,2013-10-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,STRENGTHS:    Your class has an environment of respect which is evidenced by the way you speak to your students and your speak to you and to each other.   In addition you have set high expectations for each of your students which was evident by the rich charts and posters on the walls and board.   The communication with your students is clear and thoughtful. Your presentation is absent of content errors and contain clear explanations  of concepts and strategies.   During the activity "run around" all of the students were engaged in the work at hand.    Growth:    Using Assessment in Instruction: Realizing all that must be done during the presentation of any lesson it is important to be sure that students understand how their work will be evaluated.Therefore the goal is to move toward the assessment being fully integrated into the instruction through formative assessment. There should also be evidence that students are contributing to the assessment criteria.     Questioning and discussion techniques: Please take a look at the Danielson 2013 Rubric 3(b) effective and highly effective. A goal should be to create a discussion among students providing adequate time for students to respond and stepping aside when doing so is appropriate.    Please feel free to meet with me to discuss the above.I will visit your classes on Nov. 21 2013.

How do the lesson objectives require students to increase their independence applying transferable skills across contexts over increasing periods of time?    How do you communicate regularly with families regarding students' progress and opportunities to engage in community-based resources as appropriate?    Thank you
0903338,2014,477893,2014-06-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for June 3 2014.    I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for you total dedication to the science dept. and the students you teach. I am sure that your students will leave your class prepared to go on to the next challenging level of study.    Thank you.

As we move forward I will focus the next set of observations on students assessment and questioning/discussion techniques. Continue to do the great work for your students.     Thank You     Mr. G. Stanislaus
0903338,2015,679982,2015-04-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Yip    It was a pleasure to visit your science class with 607 as they began a new solubility investigation which asks student-groups to design an experiment and teach it to the class.  You began the lesson with a great discussion question about the qualities of an engaging presentation.  Students generated an amazingly comprehensive list of presentation skills and ideas ultimately generating their own rubric!  Your inquiry approach to launching this project was thought-provoking as you used high-order open-ended thinking questions throughout the lesson such as "what conditions affect solubility?" and "how does a presenter help you learn new facts ideas vocabulary in an engaging way?"      You provided students up front with graphic organizers a self-made brainstorming packet and a rubric for the overall investigative project.  Once students were assigned groups and had their materials ready you provided a clear structure for them to brainstorm how they will plan design teach mixture/solutions in their demo and present their information to the class.      Your approach to having the students teach and assess one another uses an inventive inquiry model that makes science exciting while learning the scientific method and ultimately how to write a lab report.      Thank you for your dedication and hard work.
0903338,2015,694878,2015-04-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Yip    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Truly it was amazing to witness all of your students working in their groups and preparing to present their finding from their lab activity on solubility. The rubric design was clear to all and they took their responsibility very seriously. Student were clear on the assessment criteria.     Thank you     Mr. G Stanislaus
0903338,2015,768732,2015-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Yip    Thank you for allowing me to observe your class.  The students were working on a practice lab for the MOSL test.  The students were asking about the data tables and using the results you explained that they should put a question mark on the items that that you are unsure of and they should have written out sections.  You were moving to work with individual students and allowed for "a few more minutes" a number of times.    In order to keep the class on track please consider using a timer (or count down clock).  Some of your colleagues use this and project it on the screen to keep the kids (and by extension themselves) on time.  It might allow you to cover the material and have more time for student questions or discussions.
0903338,2016,785754,2015-10-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Yip    Throughout the lesson all of your students were engaged. You were able to use technology to have students show their work. When we meet with the other teachers on your grade we will discuss questioning and discussion techniques. This will be one of our focuses this year. Lets also discuss the upcoming student assessment for November.    Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus
0903338,2016,989465,2016-05-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Yip    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. You have laid a strong foundation for all of your students to excel as they move to the next grade. Your students demonstrate a unique level of organization and basic skills needed for success in their learning journey.     What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?  How do you connect pair group and class discussions to writing and opportunities to extend learning?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
0903338,2016,990818,2016-05-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Yip  It was a pleasure to visit your science lab with class 609 as they worked on their educational booklets for Education for Sustainability/Green Infrastructure Project.  You asked students to look at Tool #7 and to add a few more tasks to the checklist as they worked on their educational booklet drafts.  Students self-assessed their progress on their draft by reviewing the checklist together and then making a plan in the graphic organizer.  Your planning tools helped students self-assess and strategically and efficiently plan their next steps as well as allow you to assess the progress of each group and provide instant feedback.  Each group discussed how they would move forward "We need to format this page" or "screen share on google hang out" or "add more vocabulary to that page" or "highlight the research we used."  Students discussed and quickly got working on the areas they still needed to complete in their draft.  Topics included Permeable Pavers Downspout Planters Tree Pits Rain Gardens and Green Roofs.  Students were clearly excited about the work involved in being stewards of sustainability and shared a wealth of knowledge in their booklets.  I look forward to seeing their presentations at the EXPO!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students and project-based learning.
0903338,2017,1070784,2016-10-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Yip    Thank you for allowing me to visit your classroom. Your students are being prepared for success in future science courses. Your planning continues to build in a manner that supports all of your students learning. Please review the questions below.    1. How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?  2. In your lesson how do you group your students and why?    Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus.  Assistant principal
0911893,2014,105446,2014-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The rubric for assessment was missing.  The students stated that they would receive it later.  In order for the students to self correct within the group it would be beneficial for the rubric to be displayed or distributed during the initial stage of the project rather than for a final review.
0911893,2014,173367,2014-02-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,Your lessons are well planned.  Please allow the students time to process a question so that they can extend the response and apply critical thinking skills orally as well as in the written work.
0911893,2014,302453,2014-03-25 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,Mr. Goldstein I was wondering how you were assessing the students who were working in groups.  Even though you were working with individual students at the desk you might have considered doing a quick check in with the groups as well.
0911893,2014,266134,2014-04-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Goldstein over the next two weeks I will set up a time to meet to discuss the artifacts that may be needed to complete your annual evaluation.  Thank you for your commitment to your students and the learning environment you have established.
0911893,2014,326508,2014-05-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Both you and your co - teacher have worked to establish a culture for learning.     After careful review please feel free to submit any artifacts to support both 4e (Growing and Developing Professionally) and 4f. (Showing Professionalism).     Thank you.
0911893,2014,463375,2014-06-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for June 3 2014.    How do you plan collaboratively with your co-teacher and /or support personnel?    How do you stay current regarding research based practices. using a variety of resources?    Thank You
0911893,2015,589647,2015-01-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Goldstein    When I entered the room the students were preparing for the lesson and you were speaking to a student at the desk and then went on the computer for information.  The students read on the projection:  Ch 33  Add to chart if necessary or new sheet  document 5-7 quick facts about Williamsburg.  The students clearly understood what was expected.  You moved to the tables to check in and then had a student hand out a sheet which was reviewed.  The homework was explained and the students then continued to focus on gleaning information from the Hakim book to complete the assigned work.  You moved among the tables to check-in and answer some student questions.  Wonderings:  How were the student groupings created for this lesson? How did (do)the groupings improve the learning?  Next steps to consider:  Ask the students to assess their own effectiveness in the group.  Is the group effective? How can the students improve the group?
0911893,2015,640288,2015-03-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Goldstein    Thank you for allowing me to visit your classroom. Some questions to think about for the future visits.    How did students know the assessment criteria?  How do you provide students with feedback on their progress?  How do students use the assessment criteria to check their work?     Thank you     Mr. G Stanislaus
0911893,2015,718834,2015-05-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Goldstein  It was a pleasure to visit your social studies class with 712.  Students were learning about the New Jersey Plan and the Virginia Plan by comparing and discussing the pros and cons of each as related to the bigger question around equal representation among states.  Students worked cooperatively in discussion groups listing their ideas and using evidence from the text to support their claims.  You facilitated a whole class share/discussion leading to the reasons behind the Great Compromise.  Students were then given the document to read along with an activity to complete in their groups that would highlight how ideas from both the New Jersey and Virginia Plans were merged into the Great Compromise.  Wonderings: Will this unit culminate in students writing or debating about Equal Representation or another aspect of this unit on government? You have certainly prepared them for this work with your discussion handouts and notes on legislature.  Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0911893,2015,767693,2015-05-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Goldstein    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. In addition to teaching your students with humor and dedication you have assisted the entire department with your willingness to grade MOSL exams that that enabled our school to meet required deadlines. As we move forward what are some professional development activities you feel would be helpful to you. Have a great summer.    Thank you  Mr. Gregory Stanislaus
0911893,2016,873241,2016-01-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Goldstein    Thank you for allowing me to visit your classroom. The project they were working on was both innovative and exciting. This was evident by the level of engagement of the entire class. Moving forward consider the following questions below.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding  How do you use discussion among students? Why?  What are the criteria for for assessing the students'work?  How do the students use the assessment criteria to check their work?    Thank you  Mr. g Stanislaus
0911893,2016,874073,2016-01-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,When I entered the room the students were working to highlight a section from Roger Williams Letter to Providence (1655).  They were working in pairs and small groups to identify symbolism and interpret what was being symbolized.  The students had a graphic organizer to help focus the work.  This was a part of a multi-day lesson which will culminate in a picture book project.  After Mr. Goldstein reviewed the work with the students the students were asked to summarize the position (Roger William's idea) on government.  The students worked independently and then were prompted to share.    Mr. Goldstein this lesson not only asked the students to look through a Social Studies lens but enhanced the ELA lessons on metaphor.  This was a nice cross curricular connection for the students.  It helps that all learning is related and each subject helps build all other subject areas.    I would love to see the finished project.
0911893,2016,996827,2016-05-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Goldstein    Thank you allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. Throughout this year you have really established an environment that supported many different types of learners. Your students are prepared to go to the next level of their middle school experience. All of your projects were well prepared and worked to unify several different disciplines.     How do you connect pair group and class discussions to writing and/or opportunities to extend thinking?  How do students use the assessment criteria to check their work?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0911893,2016,1013274,2016-05-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Goldstein  It was a pleasure to visit your science lesson with class 705. Students were thoroughly engaged in the final stages of a variety of activities including writing group lab reports on soil testing writing brochures flyers posters and creating soil profiles by layering horizons of soil to create models of 'good' and 'bad' soil conditions for growing.  These soil profiles helped to further explain their soil testing findings and the importance of nutrients and pH in the soil.  Students explained to me how each of these projects is connected to teaching others about how the soil and water was polluted by industry around the canal many years ago and the ways people can help change these conditions moving forward.  Students recently visited the Gowanus Canal with you on a field trip for soil testing and created these projects for the culminating EXPO (taking place tomorrow). One group even interviewed councilmember Brad Lander on the issue and added the transcript as part of their poster presentation. You conferred with each group to plan final steps and get them ready for their presentations at the first annual EXPO.  Your students were clearly excited to be learning about quality soil bioswales permeable pavers and how to mobilize the community around improving the Gowanus watershed.  Thank you for co-creating this project-based learning unit on the Gowanus Canal and providing this unique opportunity for our students to become citizen-scientists.
0912824,2014,104458,2014-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Nest Steps:  Danielle - a priority area to focus next steps would be in 3c engaging students in learning.  I suggested you try out other strategies to make vocabulary a bit more fun and engaging and less teacher directed.  You might ask kids to create interview questions using the vocabulary words (different groups can have different words) and then have a conversation in which they have to apply the words. Where have you seen a rotunda? Or have kids create test questions for another group. Then they could test each other. If you assign roles to the groups one could make sure all students are accountable for the proper definitions of all the words without having to use whole class time to go over something that everyone already has in their notebooks.  This little tweak in a lesson makes it go from low on the DOK to high and from effective to highly effective!!  Thanks for your dedication to your students!
0912824,2014,138230,2014-02-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Next Steps:  -An activity such as this that requires collaborative writing could have increased student participation by assembling smaller groups.  Groups of 4 or more in this instance were having trouble making their contributions as one or two students dominated the development of ideas and the writing of the group story.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication!
0912824,2014,205759,2014-03-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Thank you for participating in this lab site PD with Maggie. Your efforts and contributions are valuable to your colleagues and the school in an effort to improve student achievement among our ICT students.
0912824,2014,286430,2014-05-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Isaacs  It was a pleasure to see you teach your reading lesson to class 604.  Holding students accountable to their reading goals with logs and learning targets is an effective way to helping students actually accomplish these goals.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work.
0912824,2014,362874,2014-05-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Isaacs  Your 6th graders were very excited to discuss their ideas and identify the purpose or lessons of these myths.  They read their writing to one another and then recorded their ideas on the communal page that was being passed from group to group.  Students explained and argued their ideas using evidence from the text and their own writing. A very lively lesson! I look forward to seeing the myths they create in their writing.
0912824,2014,393399,2014-05-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Isaacs  Students used your graphic list of myths and their notes to synthesize trends they have learned by reading myths in this unit.  You prepared independent learning time for this and then an opportunity to share in groups.  Students understand their knowledge of myths will contribute to the next phase of this unit.  Thanks!
0912824,2015,650301,2015-03-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Danielle  It was a pleasure to observe your reading lesson on Exploring Mood with class 613.  In preparation of the state exam you weaved 'test-prep' type questions into reading a play and analyzing mood changes in mood and the evidence to support the claim.  Students read the play answered the questions and shared with the class.  Students were comfortable sharing their work with the whole class being critiqued by peers and could even 'score' the work with a deep understanding of the 'short-answer rubric.'  Students were able to identify the details evidence quotes and the vocabulary that made the answer get full credit.  The lesson was a great example of how to get ready for the test in an authentic way - reading a play thinking analyzing and writing with evidence - no workbooks!
0912824,2015,688058,2015-04-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Isaacs    It was a pleasure to visit your class. Your classes are organized for learning and really an exciting place to be.Questions to think about.     What are the criteria for assessing student work?  How do you provide students with feedback on their progress?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0912824,2015,712635,2015-05-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,When I entered the room the students were working with the teacher on annotations.  The teacher was demonstrating where students could/would annotate while the students were sharing the when why and how.    Ms. Isaacs    It was wonderful watching you interact with the class this afternoon.  The students were very forthcoming with answers to questions about annotation. The great examples that were used allowed all of the students to find a unique way to practice the skill.    Perhaps you could consider allowing the students to actually demonstrate annotating a text on the projector instead of having them talk you through the process. This might allow for additional differentiation in the lesson.     Thank you for allowing me to learn annotation with grade 6.
0912824,2015,742138,2015-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Isaacs  It was a pleasure to visit your reading class with 608 as you discussed the overall themes and issues in the book The Outsiders.  In a whole class discussion students offered their ideas about themes in the book and supported their claim with textual evidence.  Students said that societal roles class family and poverty were overarching themes.  You were getting students ready to finish the book as a read-a-loud and then compare it the movie.  Next Steps:  To increase participation and engagement consider writing out 2 or 3 questions on the board ("What is a theme?  What were the important themes in the book?  How do you know - evidence?")and giving small groups about 10 minutes to discuss before they share out as a whole class.  Small group discussions give voice to students who are less likely to raise their hands.  Small group discussions also give students more control and accountability in the conversation.    Thanks for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0912824,2016,892232,2016-02-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Isaacs  It was a pleasure to visit your reading lesson with class 611.  Students were reading silently when I entered and then they quickly jotted down their homework (which included learning target goals for this new marking period) before you began the minilesson.  In your lesson you reminded students how they were analyzing story elements making inferences and synthesizing last week and how you would be focusing on 'character' this week.  You read and displayed notes on characters' importance to a story and its theme.  You told them that you would be reading a poem written in 1966 and discussed the climate of that era.  Then you read "Please Hear What I'm Not Saying" by Charles C. Finn.  Line by line students where asked to analyze jot what they think it means and students shared their thoughts throughout the activity.  Next Steps:  Although your explanation about the impact characters have on a story was insightful perhaps the notes students copied could be summarized/bulleted/abridged so that several minutes of copying doesn't take students away from the real work of critical thinking analyzing and discussing.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0912824,2016,919201,2016-02-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Isaacs    I enjoyed observing your classroom today; it was obvious that the lesson was planned in advance and according to students' needs. The co-teaching model "Alternative Teaching" that you and Ms. Deleo-Villandre employed provided your students with necessary supports and you were able to individually conference while the other students worked on character attributes in their independent reading books.    One recommendation is that if you and Ms. Deleo-Villandre frequently utilize the "Alternative Teaching"  method that you ensure the groups vary with purpose and composition so that students are not just pulled out of class because they receive special education programs or services.     Sincerely    Marcy Sterlis

The environment enhances the learning experience. All of your students are engaged and understand your expectations. Although you are very clear in your directions and instructions you tend to speak extremely fast and may be a challenge for some to keep up. Below are some questions to consider moving forward.     How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding ?  How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus

The students were reviewing a prior lesson and you were passing out review sheets to each table.  The topic at hand was "conflict".  You reviewed with the students types of conflict found in literature and asked them to make connections to readings.  The students were very excited to participate and you moved them toward a character analysis using Peter Pan (a book they had studied earlier) as an example.  The students moved into groups to analyze characters.  Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this class.

You have provided great support in an inclusive atmosphere - a win-win for everyone involved.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0914919,2014,284952,2014-04-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Deleo    You continue to work along with your co-teacher to establish an environment of respect and rapport and a culture for learning.     I will set up a meeting time for Monday May 5th 2014 to discuss areas that can be focused on for the rest of the school year.     In order to complete your annual evaluation I am asking that you turn in artifacts to support 4a. (Reflecting on Teaching) 4b. (Maintaining accurate records) 4c.(Communicating with families)    Thank you for your commitment to you students and the school.

Your attention to students' needs helped faciliate their diary revisions.  Most all the students had at least one revision by the end of the period.  Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0914919,2014,329404,2014-05-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Villandre  You used a variety of visuals in your lesson to address the mixed ability levels in the classroom.  Students were engaged in reading their non fiction article or book as they identified text structure to help them better comprehend the meaning of the text.  You had several charts and handouts to support this work at many levels.  Thank you for your dedication to making your students thoughtful readers and writers!
0914919,2015,522301,2014-10-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Freddie  I enjoyed your lesson with class 809!  Your slides were easy to read helping visual learners and also connected the task to our school wide instructional focus of evidence in argument.   Next Steps:  Many of your students needed a bit more time to think talk and write during the brief activity times in the lesson.  Perhaps the pacing could have provided more time for students to produce this work.  Also I have provided you with more information on learning targets so that standards are incorporated into your planning and that students understand their accomplishments via these "I can" statements.  Thank you for your dedication to your students!
0914919,2015,628679,2015-02-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Deleo    I enjoyed visiting your class. As we move forward as a school we will continue to focus on the questioning and discussion techniques. I look forward to continuing to work with you on the SIT team.    Thank you    Mr. Gregory Stanislaus
0914919,2015,739366,2015-05-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Villandre    It was nice to see the ICT class so engaged and fighting to make the points when you were working on the venn diagram together.  The class was working with 2 myths and were moving on to look at a variant of one of the stories that they had read previously.    Wondering:    How were the texts differentiated for the many different learning types in the classroom?
0914919,2015,747372,2015-05-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Deleo    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. As the ICT teacher I would like to know how the planning has been going with your co-teacher. The following are questions to think about. Also to what degree does your co-teacher know the flow of your lesson on any given day. She did not seem sure of the direction of your lesson.    What conceptual and content understanding did you want students to learn from this lesson?  How did lesson activities support students in learning the content or concept?    Thank you    Mr. Gregory Stanislaus
0914919,2016,861130,2015-11-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Deleo    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. Your students are very familiar with the classroom structure and teaching expectations. The powerpoint presentations  are part of their  daily routine. You were able to hold all of your students attention throughout the lesson and they seem to enjoy the power point presentation. Moving forward the two areas that may need more focus would be questioning and discussion techniques and designing coherent instruction. Think about the following questions.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?  How do you use  discussion among  students? Why?  How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagements?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0914919,2016,895549,2016-02-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Deleo-Villandre    I enjoyed observing you teach today and your active role in the co-taught classroom.  Your research of earthquakes prior to teaching it to develop your own background knowledge and providing additional resources and supports for students to ensure their understanding of the content demonstrates your commitment to effective teaching practices.    If you review "Domain 3: Instruction" components to move from "Effective" to "Highly Effective" students initiate learning. If you are interested in exploring ways to incorporate this into your instruction I'd be happy to support you.    Marcy Sterlis
0914919,2016,911128,2016-02-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Deleo-Villandre    It was great to see you use the co-teaching model "Alternative Teaching" with Ms. Isaacs and to have Ms. Retkinski join your small group and provide push-in speech services.  Your modifications and accommodations were well thought out and provided students with necessary supports.    One recommendation is that if you and Ms.Isaacs frequently utilize  "Alternative Teaching" that you ensure the groups vary with purpose and composition so that students are not just pulled out of class because they receive special education programs or services.   Sincerely    Marcy Sterlis

Using the handout as a guide to follow the procedures students assigned roles within their teams and collected data using the measuring sticks stop watch flash lights and toy cars.  They also needed to calculate average speed of light.  You visited each group to assess their progress ask questions and hold students accountable for their work ("let's look at your results I see your paper is blank but you are on the second part let's go back and record what we know"). At one point in the lesson you escorted one group into the hallway so that they could work in a more quiet and focused environment that would better suit their learning style.  Wonderings:  How could the summary questions be further modified for students who may have had trouble connecting the data collection to the overall concept of average speed of light and electromagnetic waves?  How do you assess/track the progress of your students during this type of laboratory class?    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!  How do you track your students
0919135,2014,66507,2013-12-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,Ms. DeMeo during the observation the student were working on the dialogue project and you were providing targeted instruction to one small group.  As a result the majority of the students needed to seek you out for assistance (which you offered gladly).    Next step:    Circulate more during the small group work so that you can provide specific feedback to the majority of the students.
0919135,2014,105460,2014-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,When you have completed the review of adjectives what is the assessment?  Please provide a copy of the assessment.

The peer editing was wonderful.  The students are appreciating the French language more everyday please continue to raise the level of questioning and have the students expand on the answers that they present during the discussions.

The teacher had the goals/assignment on the board.  The students were working on exercises on the computer and were able to listen to pronunciation as well as read and write.  The lesson was a part of a "mini-dialogue" unit.
0919135,2014,416119,2014-06-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. De Meo  It was a pleasure to visit your French class today with 702.  Students were engaged in the mini-lesson and then worked cooperatively within their groups and with their partners.  Students used their notes handouts and charts in the room as a resource and you facilitated and checked for understanding.  Thank you for your dedication to your students!

They interacted with each other as well as you and you asked them to defend the answers.  Please continue to have the students defend answers and expand upon the responses of others.
0919135,2015,564249,2014-11-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. DeMeo    Thank you for welcoming me into your class.     Greg Stanislaus

When the class filed in they reminded you that they had completed the movie.  You then moved to a discussion of the movie (5 minutes in groups) but you told the students to speak in English rather than in French.  The students indicated that the movie was in French with English subtitles.    After the 5 minutes the class shared the conversations and you asked a series of follow-up questions.  You also asked students to explain the thinking.  Wondering:  How is the movie being used after the viewing?  Is there a project reviewessay or other written work expected of the class?  How do you use the discussion to increase student engagement?  What assessment criteria is used?    Please be sure to have a Learning Target for the class.

The students were excited by the lesson presented. You were able to differentiate the lesson to allow all students an opportunity to be a part.Some questions to think about.     How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0919135,2015,747415,2015-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. DeMeo  When I entered the room you were speaking French to the students in 802 and they were listening and responding in French.  After a few instructions you gave a mini lesson on conjugating reflexive verbs and identifying reflexive pronouns.  Students took notes and recited the conjugations of the reflexive verb se lever.  After some whole class practice and truly excellent student-generated questions students had time to practice their new skill.  Next steps: I look forward to hearing 802 use their new found skills in their French discussions!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0919135,2016,793463,2015-10-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,As discussed following the observation during the lesson you used examples that interested students and you asked questions using comparisons/differences to help them understand.     Questions to reflect upon for component "Engaging Students in Learning":    During the observation you led students through a series of questions and as I was leaving the classroom students were asked to "Turn and Talk." What are some types of activities you could employ that require complex thinking and that challenge students to explain their thinking?     During the observation you used "detention" as a way to get more students to respond to your questions.  In post-observation discussion you said that all your students know your humorous way.  What are other strategies you could employ to motivate students to participate?    I have some resources on student engagement- if you would like to peruse any let me know.    Marcy
0919135,2016,880729,2016-01-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. DeMeo    It was a pleasure observing your classroom today; it was evident that you plan lessons and activities with the middle school student in mind. Students were excited to present their group dialogues and the class/audience was entertained and engaged during them.     Marcy Sterlis
0919135,2016,966600,2016-04-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. DeMeo    Your interactions with students today demonstrated your commitment not only to their academic growth but also their social and emotional growth. It is commendable that you took time to address concerns and then quickly refocused students on the task.    Based on my observation there are two things you might consider when developing a new unit that involves a project: (3c.) Allow students to select their country and have them create questions they want to research and (3d.) Let students develop evaluation criteria and have them self-assess at the end of the project (e.g. create a rubric at the onset and have a student assess and teacher assess column).
0919135,2016,967062,2016-04-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. DeMeo  It was a pleasure to visit your French second language class with 806.  Students had completed a homework assignment - a one page journal entry after completing a list of writing ideas in class.  Many students wrote a full page or more and one student volunteered to share with the class.  You projected her writing on the screen and modeled how peer reviewers should analyze their partner's writing to improve it check conjugations spelling details and vocabulary.  You asked students to make suggestions that would improve her work.  Students said she should give more details explain her feelings better use more adjectives and to elaborate on certain topics.  Then students partnered and switched papers so that they could peer edit and make suggestions.  In an effort to help their classmates students read analyzed and made suggestions to improve their peer's writing to get it closer to publishing-ready.  Highlights:  Students took the job of editing their partner's paper very seriously.  They read corrected and discussed aspects of each other's paper in a sincere attempt to make it better.  The conversations were rich and helpful in moving toward the goal. You faciliated and checked in with each student as needed.  Next Steps:  To make the peer work even more rigorous students could have used a checklist for improvement rubric for the journal entry writing or a model paper in order to compare the work .    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

Your willingness to work with the Grade 8 team to make the overnight trip a safe and secure time for the students is greatly appreciated.  I have observed you working with very large groups both in the school and in a more relaxed location and am impressed with your ability to manage all of the students with respect and patience.

The class was actively participating in various locations in the space while some of the other students were doing the run through.  You are able to monitor the progress of all of the students and make corrections to many different groups at once all while running the sound and lights.  The presentation the next night was spectacular!  The final piece (which was put together late in the rehearsal time) was a show stopper!    I look forward to returning to the studio.

Students connected all the segments of the dance as you assessed their choreography and overall performance.  You retaught areas that needed more work and students immediately applied your techniques to their next run through.  To your credit your dancers are poised and confident not afraid to take risks and try their very best even with such challenging choreography!  They looked amazing!  Brava!  Thanks for your hard work and dedication to your students.  Looking forward to seeing your show in May!

It was a pleasure and I look forward to future performances. In this performance class:    How do you use discussion among students? Why?  How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?    Thank You    Mr. G Stanislaus

The students were taking positions and were actively engaging each other when they discussed crossing and where each part of the dance would take them on the stage.  Ms. Gibson worked with the students from the perspective of an audience member to be sure that each student would be seen.      Ms. Gibson    Thank you for allowing me to observe your class as you worked with them in the staging of the show.  The students were very aware of the expectations of the performance and were actively working to raise the bar on the performance.  I am sure that the final product will be spectacular.

When I entered the room the Dance students were sitting behind African Drums and you (along with the guest teacher) were teaching the students about the different types of drums.  You both explained the historical/cultural significance of each type of drum and the sounds that would be made.  You allowed the students to draw connections to dance and movements that they knew and demonstrate the movement.  The students were taught to play each drum through the use of "call and response".  You modeled the activity as the guest taught.  As the students were working you moved to each student to make corrections and answer any questions.  The students then used this activity to create dance movements and "counts".    This activity was very well planned with the guest artist.  It connected dance to history and music.  Thank you again for this great experience.

You were demonstrating the movements as they were following.  You had them work in groups(two's then fours and whole group) in order to perfect the section of the piece being learned.  The students were very skilled at making corrections and following your demonstration.  This unit will be very exciting when it is completed and presented as a part of the larger show.  Thank you for allowing me to come to your room and be a part of the great dance experience.

You then had the students perform in groups.  You made corrections T:"You have to leave the ground in order for it to be a jump...look(demonstrated"    This class was working in small groups to deal with spacing issues and correcting the missteps.    Wondering:  How do you motivate the students in grade 8 to be so excited to still be dancing?
0933920,2016,976234,2016-04-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Gibson  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade dance class.  Students were warming up then line dancing and then practicing choreography for the "Black or White" number.  In each activity you modeled and assessed their proficency and then provided feedback to help all students learn the choreography to the best of their ability.  You anticipated problems in learning certain moves and clarified the steps by reteaching (through demonstration) and repeating so that students had many opportunities to practice and learn.  Students were completely engaged and obviously enjoying themselves.  For the time I was there I saw many students improve their understanding of the choreography and improve their dance moves!   It was really wonderful to see your dancers in action as they learn complicated choreography confidence and become accomplished dancers.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your dance program.

The students in 8T2 were adding to the self created choreography and critiquing the work as they moved from section to section. The ownership that the students have for individual pieces shows the confidence that you have instilled over the past three years.  Thank you for allowing me to view the small part of the class today.
0944673,2014,58677,2013-11-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Strengths:   It was very apparent that you have taken the time as an instructor to get to know your students their strength and areas of challenge.  Your ability to communicate with your students in a way that they can relate to and really understand the material.Your style of engaging your students in the learning process.  In addition I would like to commend you on your presentation of the lesson and your choice to use music in your presentation demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness to your students.    Growth:  As we continue to grow as a math department there will be a focus on the use of questioning and discussion techniques. Over the next couple of weeks I would like to discuss how you incorporate the questions into your lesson planning.     It is our goal that teachers use a variety of questions to challenge students cognitively and advance high-level thinking and discourse. Please take some time to review the Danielson Framework 3(b).    Next steps:   I will sent you a copy of the information I received from a workshop on questioning and discussion techniques.We will then set up a time to meet and discuss next steps.

Many of your students are ready to think and apply knowledge by discussing math concepts.  Try developing some probing open ended questions that require students to think discuss or write about the math concept.  Asking them to share their solutions also gets them to "teach" their method for an even deeper understanding of problem solving.  Thanks for your dedication and hard work!
0944673,2014,175546,2014-01-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Would like to take this opportunity to compliment the work that you are doing in your classes. Your level of commitment is demonstrated in the quality of instruction your students are receiving.   Your students parents are very satisfied with the level of communication they are receiving about their children.     I would like to set up a meeting so that we can discuss the upcoming artifacts needed to complete your yearly evaluation. I will check schedules and let you know of the best time.

Both you and your co-teacher worked together to establish a culture for learning and a place of respect and rapport.     I will be performing your last informal observation the week of 5/20/2014The focus will be on Danielson 3b. Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques.

How are the questions you ask specific guiding and open-ended as appropriate in order to scaffold students' critical thinking?    How do you incorporate the principles of Universal Design for learning (UDL) to give all students access to the curriculum?    Thank You.
0944673,2015,565623,2014-11-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Ng    It was a pleasure to visit your class. as a school we will continue to work to use questioning and discussion techniques engage students in all lessons. your work with your co teacher is evident and the student benefit greatly for both of you working together.     Greg Stanislaus
0944673,2015,581168,2015-01-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Wonderings:    You asked the students many questions but never asked the students how he/she knew the answer that was being given.  Students need to be able to explain how they got the answer. Please consider prompting them to explain how they arrived at the answer that they are giving in order to support the school-wide focus on evidence.    Thank you for allowing me to observe this class.
0944673,2015,638709,2015-03-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Ng  It was a pleasure to visit your ICT 7th grade math class with 709.  Students worked collaboratively with each other to solve equations that you wrote on the smart board.  You also allowed students to solve problems by "passing the buck" on worksheets and sharing each step of the problem.  You anticipated misconceptions as you visited student groups and reviewed each challenge.  Your visual explanations were very helpful in showing process and correct solutions.  Your co-teacher assisted many students and also students with IEPs.    Next Steps:  With so many learners at different levels after reviewing a few problems as a whole class consider providing different groups with different problem sets - some more elemental and others that increase in complexity (or that are in context).    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students and colleagues.
0944673,2015,769736,2015-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Ng    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. Your use of technology and your creative activities have really played a major part in your students being actively engaged in the lesson.  How do you feel the constant feed back  has helped improve student performance? Your dedication and commitment to your students and co-teacher has crated a positive learning environment.    Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus
0944673,2016,833764,2015-12-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Ng  I enjoyed your math lesson on adding decimals and fractions.  Although students were not engaged in group work or student-to-student discussions there were opportunities for the students to ask questions share ideas and take risks during the video problem-solving and the ball-share activities. While you were leading the lesson your co-teacher was spot-teaching and asking guiding questions to targeted students.   Wonderings:  How can you better meet the needs of your diverse learners? Knowing your students from various assessments you could split the class into groups to work on problems that can build their skill level.  It would also be a better use of your and your co-teacher's time to be working within smaller groups to help students gain access to the content.  Station teaching can help students make gains by staying engaged in the content asking more questions and allowing for more student-student/student-teacher interactions.  Thank you for your dedication to your students and your all your efforts.
0944673,2016,884645,2016-01-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Ng    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. Your classes are always so engaging and your students are held to a very high standard. You use creativity and imagination to teach old concepts in new ways.  Please review the following questions below.    How do your students know the assessment criteria?  How do the students use the assessment criteria to check their work?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0944673,2016,939882,2016-03-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Ng    Thank you for the lesson taught. Your students are well aware of the expectations you have for them. They work hard and in cooperation with you to achieve the class goals. Does your co teacher become more involved in the direct instruction at some point in the lesson or are you usually the lead teacher.    Working with your co-teacher how do you connect pair group and class discussions to writing and /or opportunities to extend thinking?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0944673,2017,1084098,2016-11-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Ng  It was a pleasure to join your math lesson with 7th graders who were solving a common core multi-step problem. Since you were toward the end of a unit you were challenging students to work in groups and help each other as they struggled through the problem.  I observed many students teaching others and some working together to co-solve the problem.  Another group was working with your co-teacher while you were conferencing with groups in the hallway.  Students were able to move around the room use the visual and seek help in many different ways in and outside the room. Once you reviewed the problem with the whole class students were able to assess their answer and to check if they showed their thinking in three main areas based on the rubric. You then had students peer assess the steps on problems that were posted in the hallway. In addition you gave students the opportunity to assess the lesson by telling you how you could have made it better and one responded that he would have liked to see a version of the rubric before solving the problem.  Wonderings:  While the problem was certainly challenging there were a handful of students who finished before the rest of the group.  Could you provide them with additional problem solving work or assign them to the struggling groups?  There were two students up front who didn't know to convert the measurements to inches and needed some guidance - peer-teachers would have been perfect here since you and your co-teacher were managing other groups.  I know this is always a challenge in the ICT setting - planning for a large spectrum of learners.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to all the learners in your ICT learning environment!
0946839,2014,43832,2013-11-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,For next steps please have the students move up the DOK to level 3 (strategic thinking).  This can be done very simply by allowing them to make the connecting between/among the Spanish-speaking nations that the groups have researched looking for similarities and/or differences.
0946839,2014,68341,2013-12-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,During my visit I observed the students working with the "games" they had created.  The games were to share information about the Spanish speaking nations.  The students were playing the games assessing the strengths and weaknesses completing a rubric and making suggestions for changes to the students who had created the learning game.  The students were cooperatively learning and making connections among the different countries.    Next steps can include a written piece citing evidence to compare/contrast the nations that the students were learning about with the game.

Perhaps the charts that you have created can be displayed on the projector when you are in an ELA room so that the students will have an additional reference point.
0946839,2014,302296,2014-03-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,Ms. Connelly your student log shows the thought you give to the student success in your room.  I have seen you work with individual students in the cafeteria at lunch as well as in the morning based on your notes.  The time and thought you expend on this has greatly helped the students to whom you teach Spanish especially those who are very new to a second language or are the ICT learners.
0946839,2014,444652,2014-06-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The students were looking at the characteristics of verbs.  They were active and worked in groups.  The students were able to explain the thinking that they used in choosing a particular verb form.
0946839,2014,474011,2014-06-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,This lesson with class 603 was very interactive.  The students responded in Spanish and asked a variety of questions in the language.  Please continue to build upon these questioning techniques.
0946839,2015,596433,2015-01-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,When I joined class 613 the students were engaged in a celebration of the projects that they completed about Spanish speaking nations.  The students were presenting the information to each other in a variety of formats.  The students were questioning each other and the visitors and teacher were discussing the projects with each group.  The connection made by one of the groups to a charity and the work that was done to raise money for the "Barefoot Foundation" in Columbia and awareness of the needs of children in the country by the students was inspiring.    Wondering:    How did the students select the country that was studied?      Thank you for a wonderful experience.
0946839,2015,609185,2015-02-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,This lesson was accessing prior knowledge and building upon conjugation skills.  The expected outcome would be a story created by the students.  The teacher reviewed recent Spanish vocabulary and required the students to conjugate verbs.  The teacher charted student responses and questioned students to provide translations of selected words.  The class then moved on to work as a whole group (demonstration)  to create a "piggy-back" story.  The students worked together student by student to create a story in Spanish.  The students then moved to groups to work on longer more vocabulary laden stories.    Ms. Connelly  This lesson was not only dense in terms of structore and work but really fun for the students.  You made a simple Spanish vocabulary lesson into a creative student driven exploration into words and conjugations.  Thank you for allowing me to be a part of it.
0946839,2015,693157,2015-04-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Connelly    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. You have established a very warm and encouraging learning environment for your students. Just a couple of questions to think about.    What criteria is used for assessing students work?  How do students know the assessment criteria?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0946839,2015,768338,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,The students were grouped by neighborhood.  The students were working with Spanish vocabulary to create maps of the neighborhoods.  Each student was expected to contribute to the final product.  The teacher was moving around the room to answer questions and keep the students on task.    Ms. Connelly  This was a great way to integrate geography with Spanish.  The students researched the neighborhoods and were working together to create the maps and discuss what should/would be included.  They were trying to use the Spanish they have learned this year and were able to assist each other.    Please work with the Spanish team to plan for the 3 year sequence and the projects that will be done each year.  Thank you for allowing me to come into this class.

It was fun to participate in them and also to informally observe one. Students explained to me why they were having the competition and what they learned about Dia de los Muertos.     Question:  How were the students grouped/was there a rationale for them?    I look forward to observing you again.
0946839,2016,872503,2016-01-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Mrs. Connelly    It was such a pleasure to observe your class today. Students worked in collaborative groups and you facilitated. This is an example of an effective teaching strategy- it truly allowed students to be critical thinkers and to have peer discussions.

Students were following recipes that they had selected through research and had divided up the work by assigning different roles to each student in the group.  Students were reading the recipes and working cooperatively to chop measure and combine all the ingredients in a pot on the hot plate.  Once they were done they cleaned up and were instructed to come back at lunch time when the soups would be ready to eat!  You had 2 other teachers and two paras assisting to help with this amazing endeavor!  Thank you for providing this unique ooportunity to your students.  It is much more challenging to do this type of activity but such a rewarding and memorable learning experience for the students.

The focus will be on 1e. Designing Students Assessment and 3b. Questioning and Discussion techniques.     Thank you.
0947426,2014,475405,2014-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for May 27 2914.    How do you articulate areas in need of improvement in your lesson delivery for all students and specifically those with disabilities and then identify a plan of action?        Thank you.
0947426,2014,443141,2014-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the class observations for May 29 2014.    Below you will find some questions to think about as you move forward in your planning.     How do you present assignments and directions in multiple formats including text pictures film and audio?    How do you present questions in varying modalities according to students' needs.    Thank you.

Your room is delightfully organized with instructional charts as well as cooperative work spaces.  You have provided your students with a creative way to discuss research and provide evidence in argument (meeting multiple learning styles) before they write a persuasive essay.  Please continue to share your great work with your colleagues!
0951218,2014,184888,2014-03-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Next Steps and Wonderings:  Students were just beginning the critical thinking work around how authors develop theme in books and groups were working at their own pace.  Do you check each Thematic Solar System as an 'exit slip' so that you know who needs most support the next time you meet?  You facilitated the groups by asking probing questions and students used your model Solar System (which was excellent!) to help support their thinking.  Aimee - thank you for your dedication and hard work.
0951218,2014,199983,2014-03-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Aimee - I enjoyed watching you participate in the TC PD labsite with Maggie.  Your efforts and reflections in teaching are most valuable to your colleagues and our school during grade meetings and labsites.  Thank you so much for your dedication and professionalism.
0951218,2014,220624,2014-04-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,In my last observation of your class I saw students at the beginning of this project.  To see the final Thematic Solar Systems complete with Setting Conflict Synbolism Mood and Characters was really beautiful.  They were very creative and thoughtful as were their presentations.  I particularly liked how each presenter attached an adjective to the book and could provide evidence for their select word.  Next Steps and Wonderings:  How do we keep all students engaged in the presentations when they are in the audience?  Perhaps they could take notes on each part of each group's solar system and/or select a book that they want to read based on the presentation.    Thanks for your dedication to your students and your craft!
0951218,2014,304180,2014-05-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Fournier  It is always a pleasure to observe your class.  Students were so incredibly enthusiastic about learning about myths and mythological figures!  You had engaging materials (Pandora's Box in a play version inthe magazine and the original myth in the Book of Greek Myths) that student's could use to compare the different versions of Pandora's Box.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work each and every day!
0951218,2014,332501,2014-05-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Fournier  It was a pleasure to observe your lesson today as you read aloud "The Other Side" to model symbolism in a book so that students could apply this concept to the myths they are writing.  The 'myth mapping' graphic organizer helped students organize the key elements to writing their myth.  Students had ample opportunity for discussion and critical thinking about the symolism of the book and how they can apply symbolism to their own writing.  Thank you for teaching your students to be thoughtful readers and writers!
0951218,2014,389279,2014-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Fournier  Students seemed to be enjoying this vocabulary lesson that allowed students to dig deeply into the definition and use of a word.  The book they were using was age appropriate and provided everything you need to know about a word in an engaging way that could help students teach the word to the class.  Thanks for providing these opportunities to our students!
0951218,2015,583019,2015-01-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Aimee  It was a pleasure to visit your reading/writing class today with 612 as students navigated reading nonfiction and writing summaries.  Based in the CCLS your lesson provided students choice of nonfiction text to match levels and interest as well as a scaffold for writing the summary.  All students had written a template into their notebooks to outline the summary of their article and with your instruction were writing 8-12 sentence summaries including main idea and text evidence. Students had already read and highlighted the important text in their article. You were able to assess progress as you visited each table.  Thank you for your dedication to your students!
0951218,2015,607329,2015-02-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Aimee  It was a great pleasure to watch your students from 612 conduct their presentations of nonfiction reading responses.  A more creative approach to the usual nonfiction reading responses you allowed your students to be innovative and thoughtful in how they wanted to teach their nonfiction topic to their peers.  Peer tablemates thought critically about the presentation by using a rubric and scoring the presenter and explaining why they gave a particular grade. Students chose their topics and read a variety of articles or books to gain knowledge of their nonfiction topic prior to these presentations.    Wonderings:  Were students given a guide or rubric for formulating questions to ask the presenter?  Perhaps that could be part of the peer/self evaluation so that the groups can engage in higher level discussions about these very interesting topics.  Thank you for your dedication to your students and for being a leader in your department.

I enjoyed seeing how you introduced the reading of a new book to the class. There was an excitement  in the air. I look forward to visiting again to see:    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?  How do you use discussions among students? Why?    Thank You     G. Stanislaus

The students were having discussions on which book they would choose and were scanning the books to make choices.  You were moving to each group to facilitate the choices and to be sure that each student had a new book.  The conversations that were going on as the students were selecting the books were wonderfully deep.  The students read the covers made assumptions based on the artwork and argued to defend the choice he/she wanted and to sway the rest of the group.  While the final decisions were being made the students moved to work on an article that had be started in a prior lesson in the group.    Wondering:    What criteria was used to form the book club groups?

While students were coding and revising writing bibliographies or peer editing you were providing feedback on their writing via googledocs.  You have created a 21st century ELA writing lab!  Students were also able to write to you via googleclassroom and tell you how they needed help so that you could provide support more efficiently.  Students showed me their rubric essay explained their claims evidence and how they incorporated your google-feedback.   Wonderings:  How will they celebrate their work once it is published?   Thank you so much for your dedication to your craft and the innovations that you bring to MS 51!
0951218,2016,865001,2015-12-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Fournier    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. Your students are truly motivated by your presence and teaching style. Below please find a few questions to consider.    How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?  What criteria or tools did you use to craft your questions?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0951218,2016,923903,2016-03-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Fournier    When I entered the classroom you were reviewing with the class and getting the students ready to start a new novel.  The learning target "Use evidence from text to support my analysis" as well as the homework was written on the white board.  You began the study by asking the students to write ("When was a time that you felt different?")for five minutes.  You circulated among the groups to check on the progress.  You then asked the students to "quick share" with a partner.   Next you related the sharing to the novel (The Outsiders) and made sure that all students had a voice in the discussion.  You helped the students define the differences (physical cultural personality etc.) and cluster the thoughts of the group as an entre into the novel.  I look forward to seeing the final work the students craft using this novel as a launching point.    Thank you for the very interesting lesson this morning.  You then began the novel study with a read aloud of the author's note and a discussion of young adult literature.
0951218,2016,947084,2016-03-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Fournier    I enjoyed observing your classroom today. You supported your readers by clarifying and asking questions to ensure their understanding and your learning environment promoted reading for enjoyment.   Even though you were preparing your students academically for your maternity leave (having them individualize the "Glossary of Literary terms" to use as resource while you are away) I am sure they are going to miss you!      Sincerely      Marcy

Students completed a do now and pasted notes into their math notebooks while you checked the homework.  You used many different routines to build community and engagement while maintaining engagement such as "put your hands on your head if you are done shake hands to agree and da-da-da-clap."  You reviewed the do now and then began to work with small groups as your co-teacher started a mini lesson on adding fractions.  In your conferences you checked their calculations asked them guiding questions ("why did you choose 8 as the denominator?") assessed their work and commented on their methods and use of vocabulary to reinforce good habits ("Great use of vocabulary Ezra.  I like how you used the chart to find the right method."  Highlights:  The lesson was well-paced clear and coherent building on the content from the day before and the do now.  Your room is bursting with visual resources to help students comprehend content methods routines and expectations: Habits of Mind chart Independent Learner Rubric Accountable Talk rubric word Wall Parking Lot for Questions shelves of materials and homework board with a week's worth of homework.  You have a wonderful rapport with your students which added to their level of engagement and achievement.  Next Steps:  Would the use of manipulatives add another level of access to this lesson?  Let me know if you need more resources for your learning environment.  In subsequent lessons you should consider stations for providing practice challenges and additional teaching for students at different levels of mastery.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!

Any new methods can be shared school wide so I look forward to working with you and your department on this inquiry.  Thank you for your energy hard work and dedication to your students.

0962424,2014,286470,2014-05-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ryan  It is always a pleasure to visit your classroom especially when students are so engaged in reading and making progress in their learning goals.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0962424,2014,310791,2014-05-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ryan  Thank you so much for making Bully the movie part of your curriculum.  Your students were thinking critically about the movie characters and the issues presented in the film.  The comments in the students' discussion were very insightful.  You were assessing their discussion and writing.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your school and students.
0962424,2014,329256,2014-05-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ryan  It has been such a pleasure to witness great lessons in your room all year.  As you read this provacative short story students were completly engaged and participating in the discussion about the conflict structure main character and author's craft.  You asked questions that helped students unfold the goal of lesson - teaching the structure of a short story while reading and noticing the various parts and author's moves.  Thank you for motivating your students to be thoughtful readers and writers!
0962424,2015,577996,2015-01-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ryan  It was a pleasure to visit your class with 607 today!  Students were thoroughly engaged in the book the discussion question and the sharing of each other's ideas.  Their list of issues were insightful and presented with confidence.  Your transition into writing goals based on teacher feedback helped students become aware of how they can make progress initiate their own goals based on your feedback and make a plan to improve their writing.  Wonderings:  Please let me know how we can formalize teacher visits to see your work (WOW - option 3 teacher!).  Have teachers visited your class already?  If so when and what was their lens for the observation?  See attached Intervisitation Toolkit and we'll plan!  Thanks for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0962424,2015,648443,2015-03-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Healey    Thank you for such an interesting and vibrant lesson.  When I entered the room the students were copying a list of vocabulary words that you had written on the projection.  You emphasized root words suffixes and prefixes as you pronounced each one.  These verbal cues were easily picked up by the students when they "turned and talked" to find "user-friendly" definitions.  You notated as the students gave the definitions and asked the students to assist each other when they stumbled.  You then had them identify the type of word (noun verb etc.) and the students worked together to do this task.  Next you moved the students to the reading area with novels and highlighters to continue a lesson on annotation.  You focused on character and the students were working with a partner to review the prior highlights and annotations that they had made.  The students were fully engaged in the novel and were anxious to share their thoughts.    Wondering:    Do your colleagues allow you to WOW them?  If not how can I help to make that happen I would love for others to observe you.    Thank you.
0962424,2015,773303,2015-06-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,As per Ursula Mr. Stanislaus can observe Ryan in September and write it up then since she was on maternity leave last spring and he didn't get a chance to observe her.  It will be written in the fall and then we can print her summary for last year.
0962424,2016,775447,2015-09-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Healey    It was a pleasure to visit your classroom. You have and continue to set high standards for you students.From your instructional materials several different types of activities and pacing your students are given the opportunity to achieve their highest potential.     Mr. G. Stanislaus
0962424,2016,778880,2015-10-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ryan  It was a pleasure to join you and 711 in the "cocktail party" discussion about a controversial subject on child labor in the US and around the world.  Students tackled the evidence to help them analyze the problems needs and solutions surrounding child labor.  Students also explored government policy and the emotional toll on children under these dangerous working conditions in their discussions.  I heard conversations including statements such as "Children need laws to protect them on the tobacco fields" "If these laws don't get passed children will be mistreated" "There are loopholes in the system"I agree with Harriet because the article tells us..." "We need to change immigration laws as well because" "But families need the money so their children need to work." Your students tackled the complicated issues of the article and cited evidence to support their opinions.  They also showed empathy and perspective as they compared the lives of these children to their own lives in the discussion.    Your metaphor of sophisticated cocktail party conversation motivated students to follow the discussion rubric and 'dazzle' and stimulate a high level dicussion and critical analysis of the article.    Thank you for your careful planning of this lesson and excellent use of the nonfiction resources to support our schoolwide instructional goal of evidence in argument while teaching the routine for collaboration and discourse in your classroom.
0962424,2016,872385,2016-01-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Woods    I was drawn into your room when I heard you reading aloud to the students.  Your interpretation and acting ability drew the students (and me) into the world of the book.  The discussions that occurred when you broke from the text were rich and the students made connections to prior readings and their personal writing.  You had the students talk in small groups and then share out to the whole class.  When you moved to a writing piece about the character observations the students were eager to share.  S:"Miles doesn't like his step family..."S"...Miles has a better connection..."T:"...why do you think that...change...word to resentful" S:"...neglectful..."  You completed the class by asking the students to go home and ask someone about Hurricane Katrina.  This will help them with prior knowledge as they continue with the story.    Thank you for allowing me to sit in on such a great lesson.
0962424,2016,918203,2016-03-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Healy-Woods  It was a pleasure to visit your writing class with your 7th graders as they began to draft their short stories.  Their notebooks showed much thinking work around character development research and plot mountains.  Students used these tools to begin a rough draft of their realistic short stories and you modeled your own writing to get them started and to teach prologue (in multiple ways) writing in first person and inner-thinking of your character. You conferenced with students as they began to write and encouraged them to jump into the writing.  Students wrote for the remainder of the period; approximately 15-20 minutes of sustained writing.  You gave them a forecast of writing time for the rest of the week so that they could plan their work.  Thank you for your dedication to your craft and to your students!
0962424,2016,948132,2016-03-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Woods    When I entered the room the class was finishing up "mindfulness training" and the students were sharing out.  The students were very attentive and gave each other positive feedback.  The students then moved into groups to work on "test prep" and review the previous day's work.  T:"...not a tally of right and wrong...pay attention to ones you got wrong and talk to your neighbor to use strategies to figure out the correct answer..."  "...if you missed the word temple you got it wrong...take a moment to..."  The students worked together to figure out where they were making mistakes and how to avoid the mistakes in the future.  This lesson was very calm and positive.  The students did not feel pressure for the test but worked to better understand the readings.    Wondering:  How do you juxtapose reviewing for the test encouraging students to take the test and maintaining a calmness around the test?
0962424,2016,969814,2016-04-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Healey    Thank you allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. All of your students were highly engaged and willing to share thoughts. The environment you have established is one that promotes learning.    What criteria or tools do you use to craft questions?  In what ways do the use of questioning successfully support students' mastery of the objective? How do you know?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0964118,2014,62554,2013-12-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,Ms. Solomon thank you for allowing me to observe your class.  The class was very interesting and the students were thoughtful and engaged.  For a next step please work to move the student responses to DOK 3 by requiring the students to cite his/her reasoning for the answers that they provide.
0964118,2014,90447,2014-01-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The students were highly engaged and working well in the groups.  Next Step:  Please work with the students on a rubric to help the students analyze primary source documents (i.e. the paintings).
0964118,2014,304765,2014-03-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,I was impressed by the depth of knowledge that the students have and the ability to express/explain the research that they have done.
0964118,2014,399821,2014-05-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,This lesson was using a document from John Jay when I arrived.  Students were expected to cite evidence from the document when giving an answer.  This supported the school-wide goal of evidence in argument and helped the students internalize the concept.
0964118,2014,474315,2014-06-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The students were using the computer room to research 4 options as explained in the rubric.  The students were given instructions prior to the lesson on using the computers as research tools.

They were helping each other with research while the teacher was working with students to commit to a topic.  The students were given choices and an opportunity to do research before committing to a specific side of an argument.
0964118,2015,500224,2014-10-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Amy  It was such a pleasure to observe your class in the library!  You work so well with the adults in the room and between the four of you were able to assist and assess so many students in the class.  The project is well-planned and paced allowing students to work independently as well as creatively in groups for the final presentation.  Students were actively engaged in research answering questions and helping peers.  Wonderings:  Could some of the research questions on the handout be revised to help students think more critically about the explorer or the conflict they created during this time period?  Or add questions such as "What do you want to know about this explorer?" or "What is most interesting to you about this explorer and why?" to help students make connections to the facts.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0964118,2015,507944,2014-10-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Solomon thank you for again opening your classroom to me.  The students progress on the project has been wonderful.  They are able to work with each other and you have recognized the classroom "experts" and allowed them to assist the other students.    Wonderings:    1.  How could you better incorporate the ICT teacher into the group?  While she knows the students this is her only period with them in Social Studies.    2.  If the "soaring students" were offered the opportunity to research two of the explorers and perhaps write a dialogue between the two people would that have presented a greater challenge to those "high-fliers"?
0964118,2015,640375,2015-03-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Solomon    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. I really enjoyed the rich discussion that took place. You were skillful in guiding the discussion and giving students time and room to express their views.  Some questions to think about.    What criteria do you use for assessing the students' work?  How do you know that all students met the learning outcome?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0964118,2015,768200,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,The students were working on the Constitution Unit.  They were reviewing amendments and the rights of the people.  The students were preparing a debate using 4 specific amendments in groups.      Ms. Solomon    Thank you for a very interesting lesson in the ICT class.  The student groups were working together to choose and research the amendment that they had chosen to debate.  The vocabulary review at the start was informative and required the students to reason out the meaning.    Please continue to work with the grade 7 team in planning for the units your input has been very valuable to the department.
0964118,2016,801191,2015-10-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Thank you so much for allowing me to observe the class presentations of the explorers.  The students were well versed on the chosen explorer and really enjoyed presenting the information to their fellow classmates.  Students had many interesting ways of presenting the information and the connection (for some students) with the script writing project in the Drama class was very apparent.    Perhaps you might think about allowing the audience to follow-up with a question about the presentation when the groups finished.    This lesson was very well planned and executed.  The use of rubrics for each component made the students accountable for all work that was presented.    Again thank you for all of the work that you do with your students.
0964118,2016,807092,2015-11-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Solomon  I enjoyed visiting your social studies ICT 7th grade class and watching your lesson on strengths and weaknesses of primary and secondary sources.  Students thought wrote about and shared out the Do Now question and and then worked in pairs to discuss and chart the strengths and weaknesses of primary and secondary sources.  Students came up with great ideas about how a primary source/personal account may be more accurate in some ways but that a secondary source may be less biased. You and your co-teacher assessed and noted the progress of each group before they shared out and completed a class chart of the activity.  Next Steps:  Before the Do Now share-out give your students 30 seconds to speak to each other before they offer to share with the whole class.  This is just one way to keep all students engaged while providing multiple entry points into the lesson.  This was a great inquiry-based approach to learning about and analyzing the use of primary and secondary sources!  Students really had to think hard not just about what the sources represent but how we can make good use of them both.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
0964118,2016,918319,2016-03-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Thank you for allowing me to observe this class.  The students were working together as the two teachers were posing questions and circulating within the room.  The study of the Witch Trials of Salem is always a student favorite.  You took the opportunity to create a cross-curricular study as well as requiring the students to focus on evidence.  This was a very interesting lesson.
0964118,2016,1007321,2016-05-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Solomon    When I entered the room the students were working with you on clarifying questions. You made the connections with the varied books that the students were reading and the students added on to each other as the connections to "hope" and "inequality" were fleshed out.  The students then worked independently as you and Ms. Hesdra checked in with each group on work that was due and answered any additional questions.    This lesson demonstrated how closely you work with your co-teacher.  It required students to work independently as well as in groups.  Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this lesson.
0964432,2014,67139,2013-10-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Strengths:   Although your room is one of the smaller rooms you have been able to utilize the space in a way that maximizes students ability to have the best educational experience.  Your understanding and knowledge of the content is demonstrated in how you are able to engage your students in the work at hand    Growth:  As a department a goal will be in terms of using questioning and discussion techniques to: Students formulate many questions initiate topics challenge one another's thinking and make unsolicited contributions. Students themselves ensure that a;; voices are heard in the discussion.    Next Steps:    Understanding that this is an ICT class I would like to set up a meeting with you and your co-teacher to discuss strategies. The strategies of how planning is done with modifications.I will set the meeting to take place the week of Dec. 16th.
0964432,2014,242410,2014-03-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,You and your co-teacher have created a positive environment for learning and have set high standards for your students instruction.     After the vacation I will contact you to set up a time to meet to discuss the needed artifacts to complete your evaluation.This will be the week of April 21 2014.  Thank You for your commitment to your students.

How do you engage in ongoing collaboration with the special education teacher and /or content area teachers to develop units of study design lessons and select appropriate materials and instructional strategies for all students?    When do you meet with colleagues to discuss IEP progress and plan for multiple opportunities to reinforce new learning?      Thank you
0964432,2014,447803,2014-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here is the observation done during your class on May 29 2014.      I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your commitment and dedication to your students.
0964432,2014,475140,2014-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for June 6 2014.    How do you ensure frequent communication with families about progress toward IEP goals?  How do you engage in ongoing collaboration with the special education teacher to develop units of study design lessons and select appropriate materials and instructional strategies for all students?    I want to take this opportunity to thank you for all of your work and dedication to your students throughout this year.     Thank you.
0964432,2015,579155,2015-01-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Caron    Thank you for allowing me to observe your class today.  I thought your review of how to use a notebook at the start of the lesson was very appropriate and necessary for the ICT class.  It allowed the students to give meaning and value to the notebook as a tool for learning.   The lesson about benchmark percents was interesting and really challenged the students to explain the thinking.  Wonderings:  Do you have a formal (or informal) method for assessing the lesson daily?  Perhaps you can think about a quick check for understanding (if you do not already use one) in the later part of the lesson.
0964432,2015,650360,2015-03-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Caron    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. below are a couple of questions to think about as you continue your work as an educator.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  What are some other ways you have actively engaged with colleagues and administrators in professional conversations including feedback about your practice?    Thank you     Mr. G Stanislaus
0964432,2015,695216,2015-04-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Carone  It was a pleasure to visit your math class with 609.  When I entered the room students were working independently on the do now - What is 2/3 of 87?  You then selected three students who had solved the problem in different ways to go to the board and share their work.  Students identified how the methods were different and the strategies used to solve each one.  "What did she do here? Why do it this way? What does 'of' mean?"  Selected students were able to answer these questions.You then went over a new management tool for ways to work in the room as well as a new math project and students asked clarifying questions.  Wonderings:  Your project description allowed for much creativity!  However a rubric to be used as a student checklist and/or for grading would help clarify the details and expectations.  Creating rubric categories for creativity geometry characteristics dimensions calculations formulas and presentation and how to earn a 4 or less would help students meet your expectations (and they'd have fewer questions!).  Thank you for your dedication to your students!
0964432,2015,767671,2015-05-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Caron    Thank you for the opportunity to vist your classroom. As we move forward into a new year  What opportunities for professional development would you like to be involved in to enhance your content knowledge and pedagogical skill? You continue to show a gtreat level of dedication to all of your students.     Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0964432,2016,857766,2015-12-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Caron    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. You guided your students through the lesson with prior understanding of the places of challenge. How did the groupings improve the lesson?   As we move forward we will focus on questioning and discussion techniques.Questions such as    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussions to increase student participation and engagement?    Thank you  Mr. Stanislaus
0964432,2016,887302,2016-01-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Carone  It was a pleasure to visit your math class with 603.  Your mini-lesson on exponents was clear and concise.  Students had an opportunity to ask questions watch you model and explain the parts of an exponent practice as a whole class and then practice individually and with their small group.  Your questioning was open-ended and required students to think carefully and articulate their thinking in how they solved the problems.  Students were excited to take risks share their thinkingand work hard as you have created a comfortable environment with high expectations for learning - a great combination for student achievement.    Wonderings:  Do students take a pre-assessment before you start a new unit?  How do pre-assessments and other informal data inform your planning of each day/unit and your grouping of students?      Thank you for your dedication to your students!
0964432,2016,952303,2016-03-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Caron    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. you have created a positive learning environment. You are constantly checking for your students understanding and challenging them throughout the lesson.     In terms of questioning and discussion:  How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?  How do you ensure that the instructional strategies are suitable to the content and will improve student understanding?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
0964432,2016,997513,2016-05-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Caron    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Your students were involved in developing a project that you designed and modified for the class. You are preparing independent learning able to contribute to all aspects of the learning experience.    How do you know if all of your students met the learning outcome?  How do you use discussion to increase student participation?    Thank you  Mr. G.Stanislaus
0964655,2014,190119,2014-03-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Thank you for participating in this TC PD and the labsite.  Your contributions in the classroom and during professional meetings is much appreciated.
0964655,2014,194174,2014-03-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Next Steps:  As you continue to explore the writing rubric with your students to improve their extended responses consider modeling one part of the writing (for example the introduction) and revise it together using the rubric.  Showing students how to change a level 2 to a level 4 response will be extremely productive and practical for the upcoming assessment!  Thank you for dedication and hard work!
0964655,2014,289206,2014-05-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Wexler  It was a pleasure to visit your class (and participate in the discussion!) and listen to the students' discussion that you were facilitating.  Students entered into this discussion having read the article and written a subjective summary.  This was a perfect lesson for a Friday afternoon after the math test!  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!
0964655,2014,329309,2014-05-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Wexler  The discussions in your room prompted by your lessons and questions are so provacative - all students are excited to contribute and add on to others' ideas!  Students are respected by their classmates and are comfortable to take risks when sharing in the conversation.    Thank you for taking on this very important social-action issue of bullying.  It was exciting to see how the discussions are transforming our school culture.
0964655,2014,389231,2014-05-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Wexler  It was a pleasure to watch your students work independently on their short story writing.  It was also great to hear you conference with individual students to provide targeted feedback to help them improve their writing.  Wonderings: Are they using the writing rubric for this piece or is there one specifically for this short story?  Thanks!
0964655,2014,400763,2014-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Becky  It has been a pleasure watching your students develop as writers over the year.  Students were locked into learning this morning; asking high level questions regarding their revision work after your mini-lesson and then working intently on their revisions based on your handout and discussion.  Students were highly engaged and self-motivated to complete their revision work and truly looked like they were enjoying the process and craft.  Thank you for inspiring so many young writers!
0964655,2015,636715,2015-03-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Julie  It was so exciting to visit your 8th grade dance class 'behind the scenes' in your dance studio as your students learn the details of the choreography practice and refine a dance in your Bob Fosse genre/unit.  You allowed them to connect each segment of the dance try it all together and then critique and reteach the areas that needed most work.  To your credit the dancers have such poise confidence and skill as they take risks in trying out very challenging choreography and prepare for the next show.  They look amazing!  Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to your students.  I can't wait to see the next show in May!
0964655,2015,707152,2015-05-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Wexler  I enjoyed watching your 7th grade writing lesson on developing a realistic fiction short story.  Looking at their writer's notebooks it was apparent that students had had previous lessons on collecting ideas about 'issues' relevant to teens to help them choose and develop story lines and create characters. You had already approved their story proposals with feedback.  You modeled how to think about and develop story elements with a humorous fill-in-the-blank letter to you as well as the plot mountain diagram to organize the essential story elements.  The graphic organizer and student partnerships prompted students to discuss and develop their stories with student and teacher feedback. You anticipated misconceptions and story pitfalls and conferenced with groups that needed help changing their endings.  Students were highly engaged in their writing and providing peer feedback.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0964655,2015,767156,2015-05-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Wexler    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. During your lesson you asked your students questions that made them think and reflect to deepen their understanding. By using several different approaches you used activities to promote student thinking.You have shown a great commitment and dedication to your students leaning. Have a great summer.    thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0964655,2015,764206,2015-06-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Wexler  It was a pleasure to see class 710 during their ELA writing period engaged in a partner revision activity.  Students read each other's Realistic Short Fiction stories and using the Writing Assessment Rubric used a Partner Revision graphic organizer to provide their partner with 1 praise and 2 suggestions.  Students carefully read each story and used the rubric to provide positive and constructive feedback.  Students also included Goals at the bottom of the rubric so that peer assessors and teacher know about their personal goals for this writing piece.  Feedback sometimes addressed student's goals.  For example one students set a goal to include meaningful research into her story and her peer assessment included a praise that she had met her goal.  You also provided a Research for Accurate Details graphic organizer that was attached to their writing draft along with the Partner Revision organizer.  This lesson is a great way for students to peer assess learn from one another and to revise their papers before the culminating Gallery Walk publishing day.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your craft.
0964655,2016,872629,2016-01-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Wexler    The class began with a quick review of the literary essays due Friday and then as the students read silently you did a "log check".  The timer rang and the students put away the novels (they weren't happy) and they moved into the front of the room.  You then announced the new writing cycle "Short Fiction" and the students got very excited.  You proceeded with the mini lesson and the students worked in pairs and small groups to brainstorm what they already knew about short stories.  At the completion of the mini lesson you read aloud(a sample of a short story) while the students focused on identifying conflict inferences and a "plot mountain".    I have rarely seen a class so enthusiastic about writing.  Your joy and infectious laugh makes the students realize that learning new things is fun.  You made sure to include all of the students and they worked really well together.    Thank you for inviting me into this lesson.
0964655,2016,895658,2016-02-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Wexler  It was a pleasure to visit your writing class today with 612.  They were drafting their fiction short stories and had just had a lesson on Rising Action and how writers make conflict worse for their MC by showing internal struggle through descriptive actions and thoughts.  Students were discussing that concept with their peers and thinking about how they would add more internal thinking into their stories before they started to write.  Students wrote for a sustained period of time and their stamina was truly amazing.  The transition from the lesson to the writing activity was seamless with no time wasted.  While most of the students wrote one pair opted for a peer-to-peer conference in the hall (you gave them that option) and some signed up for a brief conference with you.  You were able to provide strategic feedback and scaffold the writing of more than half a dozen students in the class.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.  Please continue to share your best practices with your colleagues.
0964655,2016,947832,2016-03-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Wexler    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. Your students are constantly being challenged to be their best. You set an example of excellence for your students.     How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?  How do you ask questions that made students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
0964655,2016,948129,2016-03-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Wexler    The Grade 7 class was completely engaged in the reading of the short stories created by each other when I entered the room.  You were working on editing stories as well.  The students had comment sheets and as they finished reading they wrote on the sheets and moved on to the next story.  The student feedback included many ideas including:  "I like the ending where you talked about rap and how you kind of used that as your symbol.."  "Your story had a unique setting and you gave descriptions for people who aren't too familiar with it"  "Your story is really emotional and the language you used in the story is really touching"  All of the students were working on giving positive feedback and you were modeling the skill.    Thank you for inviting me into this interesting class.
0964655,2016,1007301,2016-05-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Wexler    When I entered the room you were working with the students on the writing process.  The students were "selecting a topic that is juicy and interesting".  They were working to narrow the individually selected topic to find social relevance.  You were using the projector to demonstrate the way a web could help with the process.  You allowed the students to choose to work with a partner or alone to narrow the focus as you checked in with each table group.  Your room is a very welcoming place where the students have in depth discussions about the writing that is being done as well as great feedback for each other.
0964655,2016,1008431,2016-05-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,

Your concrete strategies for reading and processing nonfiction text will surely be useful for all students help them in all classes and  allow teachers to continue the work in their own classes.
0967065,2014,73031,2013-12-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Related to professionalism and our Inquiry Team Meetings I hope to work with you this year on creating new protocols that will continue to help you and others on staff share best practices school wide.  The true work of inquiry is to make our best practices reach all students for greater progress in student achievement.  Your classroom is truly a place where teachers can learn.  You are a true leader in our school and I thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to your craft.
0967065,2014,138101,2014-02-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,It is always a pleasure to visit your classroom and hear your students thoughtful responses and watch them think crtically about their work.  Thank you for sharing your talents with the community-at-large.
0967065,2014,208412,2014-03-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Your participation in the labsite and your contributions to the meeting were most valuable.  After the meeting you went on to quickly draft another lesson based on what was discussed.  You then held a labsite in your classroom the following week teaching the lesson for your colleagues to watch.    Thank you for your energy around developing labsites.  I think your colleagues are excited to continue this work beyond Maggie's visits.
0967065,2014,300769,2014-05-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Warren  Your classroom is a magical place!  I was drawn in by the engaging and intelligent conversations your students were having around the various characters' perspectives on love and marriage in Romeo and Juliet. Thank you for sharing your lessons with your grade team and greater community of teachers.
0967065,2014,331033,2014-05-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Warren  I enjoyed listening to the discussion between your students as they interpreted the figurative language in Romeo and Juliet.  Students annotated Juliet's monologue identifying sophisticated oxymorons imagery and metaphors which described Juliet's complicated emotions.  Students were engaged in the discussion inferring meaning using details from the text.    Thank you for teaching our students to be thoughtful readers of Shakespeare and ultimately skillful readers of difficult text.
0967065,2015,541674,2014-11-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Kristen  It is always a pleasure to visit your classroom and see your students engaged in reading writing and thinking!  I truly appreciated the time you allowed students to spend thinking talking and writing about what they already know about research methods as you introduced the social action unit.  Your co-planning of the lesson was coherent and differentiated.  Your guided practice questions allowed students to think deeply about their topic and the activity engaged students in discussions with their peers to brainstorm what they already know about a research method.  You conferred with groups to check for understanding and allowed students to share out.    Wonderings:I was so happy to see an Essential Question and Learning Target on your board!  Please see attached information/research about Learning Targets so that we can better connect the target to the standard.  Thank you for your dedication to your craft!
0967065,2015,658173,2015-03-25 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Warren  It was a pleasure to watch your lesson on structure and meaning in the extended response with 806.  Students discussed the different genres in which authors write why an author might choose to write in this genre and what it would reveal to the reader.  Students used a graphic organizer to compare and contrast the structures of the types of writing under the theme of the Civil War.  Students recorded their ideas about the differences in how and what the author might communicate to the reader in this writing genre. Ultimately if a student/reader understands these differences that knowledge will help them make more meaning of the text.  This idea transitioned students into the next activity where students used the 'Improving the Quality of My Extended Response - Action Plan' rubric to make a plan and revise the responses they had written from a text in Upfront Magazine.    Thank you for your dedication to your students and your great team work!
0967065,2015,682586,2015-04-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,When I entered the room the class was standing in a circle in the center of the room and the students were working in pairs.  The students were interpreting pairs of lines from the prologue from Romeo and Juliet.  The teachers were working with students.  The students then were called together to give the interpretation of various lines and listen to iambic pentameter.  They also looked at and demonstrated how choral reading works and where emphasis can/should be placed.  Next they moved to table groups to discuss staging the prologue and how the group would use various stage techniques to make this section of the play come alive.    Ms. Robbins    This was very interesting.  The students had a variety of ways that they interpreted the prologue lines that you used in the pairs.  The student were able to relate this work to the work that some had done in Drama or vocal music.  The students were really sharing the ideas and were not afraid to take risks in the interpretation.  The partnership that you have with Ms. DePalma works well with this group of students and the time that you spend working on the lesson plans shows in the results achieved within the class.  Thank you for allowing me to observe this ICT class.

Your have demonstrated a great level of commitment and dedication to your students. Your students are constantly thinking and reflecting on deeper understanding of the content. This was evident  by their open discussions on the topic at hand.     Thank you  Mr.Stnislaus
0967065,2016,864301,2015-12-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Warren    This class is an ICT group that you co-teach.  The two teachers work seamlessly together.  In this lesson you were reading aloud (this was part of a series of lessons in a social action writing unit) and starting the question prompts  while the other teacher was checking in with students and taking notes.    The class broke into stations for discussion groups and students were given a choice of articles.    The team teaching in the room is a model for other teams to follow.  The evidence of co-planning is obvious as is the mutual respect that is modeled for the students.  Thank you for this lesson.
0967065,2016,869359,2016-01-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Kristen  It was a pleasure to observe your 8th grade ELA class as you surveyed where they are in the process of writing fiction.  Students came up with a plan on how they would proceed - discussing jotting plotting or drafting to name a few options.  You also provided students an opportunity to meet with you in a small group if they had questions about how to proceed.  Your goal to read all the surveys and plan a differentiated writer's workshop for the next day is evidence of formative assessment and planning from knowing the needs of your students.    I look forward to seeing the impact of your differentiated instruction as you work toward helping all students to access the writing expectations.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to all your students.

I look forward to visiting again. Here are some questions to consider moving forward.     How did the activities and /or assignments promote student thinking?  How did the activities and /or assignments ask students to explain their thinking?  In your lesson how did you group your students and why?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
0968671,2015,702958,2015-05-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Arroyo  It was a pleasure to visit your math class on Supplementary Angles with 707.  As you assisted and assessed students during the activity students volunteered to share their work with the class on the document camera.  As the student explained the answer you asked clarifying questions and asked them to share their strategies.  You emphasized the importance of 'showing thinking work and calculations' as you know from scoring the state exam showing work is required.  You also asked how students can check if their answer is correct show other ways to solve and if they had any questions.  You provided a variety of problems to solve and when students finished quickly you gave them another challenge differentiating the work for all students.  Students had an opportunity to ask questions share different strategies explain their work and challenge themselves with each problem.  Please share your best practices and continue to plan with your 7th grade team.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!
0968671,2015,739947,2015-05-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Arroyo     When I entered the room the students were working together to solve a problem using the Pythagorean Theorem.  They were led by a student who was at the projector demonstrating how he solved the problem and others questioned or changed steps.  You helped the student clarify the answer and questioned his lack of a square root.  The group work allowed the students to share a variety of ways to find the answer to the various problems.  You always asked for logic and the students were anxious to share the work with you and the entire class.    Thank you for allowing me into your room please share this success with your colleagues.
0968671,2015,769700,2015-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Arroyo    Thank you for the dedication and commitment shown to all of your students. I look for ward to working with you in the upcoming year.   I know that you keep excellent records of all of your students How do you know that all of your students have met the learning outcomes?  How do your students use the assessment criteria to check their work? Have a great summe.    Mr. Stanislaus
0968671,2016,788019,2015-10-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Arroyo    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. Moving forward there will be a focus on effective questioning and discussion techniques.     How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?    Mr. Stanislaus
0968671,2016,854481,2015-12-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Arroyo  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade math class as students were solving systems of equations by graphing.  Students helped each other as they were working on problems with varying degrees of difficulty on a handout as well as challenge questions on the board.  Students used vocabulary like slope intercept coordinates and algebraic equations.  You conferenced with each table of students to check for understanding and assist in the learning/problem solving process.  Students were clear on the homework which included Delta math online.  Most groups worked sufficiently on their own and you stayed after class to work with one student who had many questions.  I watched as you let her retrace her steps on a test so that she could see were she went wrong and ultimately found the solution on her own with you there to validate her work.  Wonderings:  Are there any real-world connections that students can make to solving systems of equations by graphing?  It's great that students can graph these systems but relating the process to something real would really help them be able to articulate what they are doing and why.  See attached handout as a resource.  Thanks for your hard work and dedication to your students!

Your students are being well prepared for the 8th grade and high school. The level of maturity and professionalism that is displayed by both teacher and student is really outstanding. You are always challenging your students as a class and as individuals to achieve their highest potential. Please think about the questions below.    In your lesson how do you group your students and why?  How do grouping students improve the learning?  How do you structure the lesson so that students are constantly engaged throughout the lesson?    Thank you.    Mr. G Stanislaus
0968671,2016,976155,2016-04-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Arroyo    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. You have always laid a strong foundation for your students future math experience. Your students are at a level where they ask the questions that cause them to reflect and deepen their understanding.     In what ways do the use of questioning  successfully support  students mastery of the objectives? How do you know?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus

Your biggest challenge is to plan instruction with your colleagues that can engage all students during the entire period; whether they are working on the same activity or different activities this is always the challenge when you have such a large group.  You obviously understand this challenge and the flow of your routines and student cooperation make it work.  Continue to focus on this challenge to bring the best most engaging learning experience to your students.  Thank you for all your hard work!

When you returned in September your remaining colleague had a medical emergency (and put on leave for the semester) and you were faced with unknown replacements over 1100 P.E. students over 300 Health students and a fitness-room renovation to complete.  Your willingness to take on ALL of these challenges and become a leader for the department has allowed the students of the school to participate in a flourishing P.E./Health program.  I thank you for all you have done to maintain the highly-effective program and congratulate you on the work that you have accomplished.  Thank you!

You and your co-teacher work together seamlessly to manage different groups simultaneously as you work with a large number of students.  You've created a gym that has a fun and comfortable environment - students were running to music and others were singing and dancing to the music! You were monitoring both groups and providing instructions as they transitioned from one activity to the next.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0971992,2015,607300,2015-02-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Gordon    Thank you for sharing the "hockey unit" with me.  The students were genuinely excited to start playing.  Your clear instructions student led demonstration and review of safety equipment worked wonderfully.  The students understand the expectations in the gym and the reasons behind the "rules'.  This very large (well over 120)group of well behaved studentsthe co-teaching and student choice is why our P.E. program is amongst the finest in the city.  Congratulations.

Students rotated in teams to play the game as you and your co-teacher instructed refereed and kept score.  Students were engaged in playing the game keeping the clock setting up the pins and/or cheering on while waiting for their turn.  Adalante is an exciting game that requires team work coordination speed and accuracy.  Students were obviously having a great time.  With so many students to manage in the gym the level of coordination and cooperation is truly amazing.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to our PE program!
0971992,2016,791593,2015-10-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Gordon  It was a pleasure to visit you during the relay race class with your 6th graders. I was very impressed by how quickly they have adapted to the routines of the gym after only a few weeks of school.  You and your co-teacher managed the logistics of the race assessment and teams of students seamlessly.  It was fun to watch the students cheer as their classmates coordinated the passing of the batton and running techniques to complete the relay.  Thank you for supporting a student teacher in your class as well.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
0971992,2016,843114,2015-12-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Gordon    The grade 7 students were completing the NYC fitness Gram.  This is a required part of the curriculum.  The students were given a demonstration from both you and your co-teacher.  You utilized the student teacher very effectively and had all of the stations ready when the students came into the gym.  The students understood each station and tried to complete the rubric.    Thank you for your organization and the mutual respect that you display with the students.

While the questions/answer session always deals with explaining and reviewing the various procedures for the class the net result is always fully engaged students who complete a variety of tasks.  The students understand the expectations of the class and are able to navigate the requirements.  This very large group (over 100 children) is always engaged active and learning new skills.  Thank you for allowing me to observe the class.

The students were involved and excited to learn a new song.  They were working cooperatively and were making connections to other subject areas and defining terms.  Your modification for the students who need it was wonderful and allowed all students in the room to learn the lyrics in a variety of ways.  Please share your method for modifications with your collegues in the Art Department.

0992530,2015,613756,2015-01-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Bianco        Thank you for opening up your class to me. The standard that has been set for all of your students is clear and respected by all While in your class it was not possible to tell which students had IEP's and which students did not. All were engaged and eager to learn and perform.     Mr. Stanislaus
0992530,2015,643504,2015-03-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Bianco  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade Chorus class today.  They have clearly learned so much about singing dancing performance and stage presence in the few months that they have been your students! They all appeared very comfortable taking risks in their dancing and singing efforts!  As they rehearsed the "Swing Low Sweet Chariot/When the Saints Go Marching In" medley you assessed their choreography retaught various parts of the song and choreography as well as praise them when they showed improvement.  They enjoyed repeating parts that needed more work and asked questions as needed.  Everyone was fully engaged and making every effort to do their best!  Thanks for your dedication and hard work as you put forth an amazing chorus program!  I can't wait for the show in May!
0992530,2015,693252,2015-04-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Bianco    Thank you for allowing me to observe and listen in your room.  The singing was wonderful and the students worked with you to make changes to the various sections and tonal qualities.  Your work with your colleagues over the past month opened eyes to the various ways that arts teachers use assessment and questioning within a classroom.      When I entered the room the students were working on a piece for the show.  The students were given suggestions to improve the song and the teacher worked one-on-one with a soloist to make corrections.  The students self assessed and made corrections to both the choreography as well as the vocal arrangement.
0992530,2016,851043,2015-12-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Sarah  It was a pleasure to watch your 8th grade chorus class as they were learning a classical piece of music.  You used many different strategies to help the various groups learn the notes to this new song in their repertoire.  Students listened to your instructions listened to the other sections sing tried out their parts and then you combined 2 parts and then 3 parts together.  Students made the appropriate adjustments and you gave them many opportunities to practice and improve.  They sounded absolutely lovely!  It was a pleasure to witness your first lesson taught on the new piano!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students and many creative opportunities you offer your students in chorus!
0992530,2016,862554,2015-12-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Bianco    This lesson was very interesting.  The students were listening to a number of pieces of music.  While they were doing this you asked them to write or draw what they imagined while listening.  The students shared with each other and with the group as a whole.  You then watched Fantasia 2000 (which had the same music) and noticed what the animators imagined from the music.  Your class discussion about similar/different was fascinating.  The students looked in depth at what the music made them feel and how others had similar or very different emotional responses.  The students wrote individual entries in the journals.  This lesson encompassed the other Arts and ELA standards.  Thank you for the wonderful lesson.
0992530,2016,875026,2016-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Bianco    This Grade 7 Vocal Music lesson fully encompassed strands from ELA and Social Studies.  You have chosen to perform a gospel song Up to the Mountain in the spring show with Grade 7 students and used the MLK holiday as an opportunity to teach the students in your class about not only the song but the speech that inspired it.  You began the class with a discussion of MLK and the time he lived.  You elicited from the students a focused detailed description of what they knew.  You then showed a short video of the speech and then continued the discussion to incorporate the lyrics and the connections.    T:"where do we see..." S:" p.10 I'll never get there..."S:"...maybe peaceful valley...promised land..."T:"..this is a part of your countries history...people you know lived through it...where can you see it still happening...S:"...little things make changes..."  You then moved to a warm-up and the students were challenged to make a part into a round.  You then looked at the music with the students and identified beats time etc.  The students did a first run (reading the music and singing as you played the piano) and you made corrections.  You then moved on to working with each section.   Thank you for inviting me into this wonderful lesson.
0992530,2016,1026912,2016-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Bianco    Today you began with the grade 7 class the audition process for high schools.  You distributed the list of performing high schools with vocal music programs and reviewed the types of auditions required by the schools.  You discussed with the students types of dress how to present yourself how to ask questions and what to wear.  The students asked questions and you were able to allow the students to flesh out the best way to audition.  You then practiced a variety or skills via following notes on a piano rhythmic clapping and sight reading.  You next allowed the students to work together to find music that they could use for an audition from your extensive collection and set a schedule for the start of the practice of the selected music.  There is a reason MS 51 is successful at auditions it is not just the talent of the children it is also the talent of the teacher who helps them prepare.  Thank you for all of your hard work.

Your students are clear on what is expected of them. Your lesson purpose is clear and the directions and procedure for specific lesson activities is well thought out .    GROWTH:    Questioning and discussion techniques.     The goal of any teacher in the area of questioning and discussion techniques must be to use a variety of questions to challenge students. It is in the development of students being able to formulate questions and topics that challenge one another's thinking.     Next Steps:    Please feel free to meet with me to discuss any concerns. I will forward to you the Appropriate Learning Opportunity Videos on questioning and discussion. We will also look at ways to incorporate more technology in your classroom presentations.

I want to thank you for you diligence in turning in all of the needed documents to complete your annual evaluation.     Thank You.
1004214,2014,427492,2014-05-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Below you will find some question to think about as we move forward.    How do you identify instructional outcomes that are Common Core aligned and as appropriate include career development and occupational standards vocational skills and functional learning outcomes?    How do the lesson objectives require students to increase their independence  applying transferable skills across contexts over increasing periods of time?    Thank you.

1004214,2015,525128,2014-10-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Santarpia    Truly enjoyed the time in your class. As a department we will continue to develop the questioning and discussion techniques that are unique to science inquiry.     Greg Stanislaus
1004214,2015,521664,2014-11-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Santarpia    I thought that the Learning Target was very current in light of the ebola epidemic.  Your students were engaged in identifying "patient zero" for a variety of diseases and had to use a number of sources and patient info to work to the target.  The students were engaged and working effectively in the groups.    Wonderings:    What criteria was used to create the groups?      Thank you for the very interesting and informative lesson.
1004214,2015,624975,2015-02-25 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Joanna  It was a pleasure to visit your science class with 807.  Your lesson was so engaging with students making connections with their own bodies (pulse rate) and the science concepts you were teaching.  Students found their pulse rates exercised measured pulse rates again and then calculated graphed and analyzed their personal data.  Students were able to discuss high level questions such as "What is the effect of physical activity on pulse rate?"  The homework required them to think critically about how this relationship affected blood flow in the body and to explain how this relates to the circulatory and respiratory systems.  Students were asked to think talk and write about their findings.  Thank you for providing your students with this meaningful inquiry-based science investigation.
1004214,2016,794137,2015-10-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Santarpia    Thank you for inviting me into your class. It was an amazing lesson. Moving forward we will focus on 3(d) Using Assessment in Instruction     What are the criteria for assessing the students' work?  How do the students know the assessment criteria?    Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus
1004214,2016,797532,2015-10-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Santarpia  It was a pleasure to visit your ICT lab on diffusion/semipermeable membranes with class 808. Students clearly had background knowledge on semipermeable membranes and had terms in their notebooks and on the board to help them make connections between what they were seeing and the concepts learned.  The students followed procedures with your help and answered questions to help them better understand what they were witnessing in the lab which modeled the semipermeable membrane of a cell.  You drove home the concept with an additional lab demonstration.  Student watched and made connections between terms learned and actual cell activity.  Students also made predictions during your demo and applied that information to their lab results.    Next Steps:  In addition to the questions and discussions you supported during the lab in order to help students synthesize this concept consider having them write/draw a diagram of diffusion mapping out where high and low concentration exist in the model cell and what each material in the lab represents in the cell.  This may help some students express what they know if a more visual way in addition to the writing and discussion challenge you have provided.  Thank you for collaborating so well with your colleagues and making this a great partnership in science!
1004214,2016,864246,2015-12-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Santarpia    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Once again you have challenged your students to take responsibility for their learning. They played a major role in the design of the lesson. By choosing their own articles you aloud them to invest in their areas of interest.Questions to considered:    In your lessons how do you group your students and why?  How do you connect pair group and class discussions to writing and /or opportunities to extend thinking?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
1004214,2016,969608,2016-04-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Santarpia    Thank you the unique experience I had while visiting your class. You have found very unique and creative ways to engage your students. Their discussions were very productive and great preparation for High School.    What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?  In what ways do you use questioning successfully to support students' mastery of the objective? How do you know?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
1004214,2017,1066265,2016-10-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Santarpis    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. It is evident that the entire 8th grade science team continues to plan and work together to ensure a positive experience for all students. Your energy and enthusiasm is contagious and creates a great learning environment.    How do you connect pair group and class discussion to lab writing and /or opportunities to extend thinking?  What are some of the ways you provide students with feedback on their progress?    Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus
1004214,2017,1078785,2016-11-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Santarpia  It was a pleasure to visit your class today as your 8th graders investigated enzymes as catalysts for starch digestion.  Students began by explaining to one another what happens to food after you chew it.  Then you guided them through the chemical equation of what happens to starches when they are digested before they started the lab.  You also provided a brief demonstration to better orient students to the purpose of the lab.    Highlights:  Students worked cooperatively and followed the procedures carefully. You provided clear instructions in doable chunks not to overwhelm with what otherwise might look like a very complicated task. This was a relevant topic and taught them many scientific skills and content about enzymes catalysts and the process of digestion.  Next Steps:  After the do now (or in a previous lesson) consider asking students to come up with some of their own questions about digestion or enzymes.  They may come up with questions that could be answered with the lab pushing them to think critically about the investigation and motivating them to seek answers and better understand the relevance of the outcome.  Wonderings:  How are you differentiating instruction for your diverse learners?    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to teaching all your 8th graders Living Environment!

The students were watching the presentation and taking notes.  You stopped to allow for the students to ask questions.  The impact that this presentation made on many of the students was palpable they understood the change they can make with the Pulsera (bracelet) Project.    To support the student learning you should have them write a reflection on the project that can be shared with the school community.
1011158,2014,183641,2014-03-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The service-learning project that you did with your class opened the student's eyes to a world problem and allowed then to play a small part in finding a solution. Thank you for finding that opportunity.
1011158,2014,399770,2014-05-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The students were engaged in the project and the presentations.  While the question and answers were in Spanish the routines were obvious and the respect apparent.
1011158,2014,418797,2014-06-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Obercian  It was a pleasure to observe your 706 Spanish lesson.  Students participated in the homework review by speaking listening and writing the answers they may have gotten wrong.  You spoke mostly Spanish during the lesson promoting thinking and learning through the second language.  The graphic organizer instructions and examples/modeling you provided for the activity were clear and engaging.    Thank you so much for your dedication and hard work!
1011158,2014,484006,2014-06-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The students were reviewing Spanish vocabulary.  They were using "question words" and were working on pairs and small groups.
1011158,2014,483988,2014-06-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The students were projecting individual work to edit together.  This idea celebrated the work while allowing for peer editing.
1011158,2015,647802,2015-03-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,When I entered the room the students were working on "tengo".  The students were working together and the teacher was notating on the projection to be sure that the students scribed correctly.  The teacher then moved to the focus "have to" and how it is used with "tengo".  Students gave examples in Spanish and added to each other's sentences.  The students moved to group work while the teacher checked in at each table.  The students shared out the teacher notated a different student was asked to translate and the students added to the individual work.  They then moved on to "vida justo' and the group worked in Spanish.  The final 5 minutes of the class was spent on a video that reviewed the daily work.  The students were instructed to listen for the phrases as the video played.      Ms. Obercian    Thank you for allowing me to observe such an interesting lesson.  The use of the very short video as a review was great and the students really seemed to enjoy it.    Wondering:    How are the native speakers divided amongst the tables?  You referenced the Spanish speakers during the lesson and I was not sure if they are references for the other students or working in a unique group.
1011158,2015,663259,2015-03-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Obercian      Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. As I entered your class all of your students were working and engaged. In addition to teaching the students a different language How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?    Thank you     Mr. G Stanislaus
1011158,2015,684405,2015-04-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Obercian    It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade Spanish class.  Students had many opportunities to write read and speak Spanish as well as listen to you speak Spanish throughout the lesson.  As you showed images of the movie they are studying in class students discussed the character's traits and motivations to help them better understand the story.  Students also had an opportunity to review the homework and work in pairs to match quotes with the characters in the movie all while engaging in Spanish speaking listening and writing.  Students seemed to really enjoy the activities and tried very hard to speak Spanish during the class conversations.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1011158,2015,742842,2015-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Obercian    When I entered the room the students were presenting projects that they had created using a variety of resources and media.  The project was presented in Spanish with the students asking/answering questions in Spanish.  The projects were very interesting and creative.  The "mock" family tree that was part of the powerpoint presentation showed the creativity thet was fostered in the room.    Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this presentation.
1011158,2016,793813,2015-10-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,As discussed in our debrief the individual assessment activity engaged students.     Something to consider:    Two students completed their assessments and asked what they should do when they were finished- both ended up reading individual silent reading books. It might be useful to have scaffolded activities set up for the advanced leaner (similarly to how you have activities set up for the lower level learner) and to communicate to the whole group what they should do if they finish in advance.
1011158,2016,857324,2015-12-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Maura  I really enjoyed visiting your 7th grade Spanish class.  You guided students through "movie-talk" using an animated film (without the sound slide by slide) so that students could get acquainted with the story line of 'Anuncio Loteria de Navidad 2015'.  Students answered your probing questions and made sense of the film by looking at the pictures.  Students then read the text of the story aloud and finally in conjunction with the film identified and matched text with what was happening in the film.  These skills of listening to the language using pictures to help infer meaning and then reading and speaking the language to tell the story are all reading skills that students can use in all classes.  Using multi-media visuals text and film allowed more students to talk about the movie and comprehend it in greater detail all while using the vocabulary in speaking to answer your questions.  Next Steps:  To make sure everyone gets a chance to practice speaking and answering questions try preparing a few questions that ask pairs of students to respond to one another instead of only to the teacher. This ensures 100% participation.     I truly appreciate the innovations you bring to teaching Spanish as a Second Language.  Thank you for your dedication to your students and hard work!
1011158,2016,872129,2016-01-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Ms. Obercian    Thank you for the opportunity to observe your classroom today. I was impressed with your students' use of classroom resources to enhance understanding without your prompting them. For example one student was using his Spanish-English dictionary and another was referring to the poster on the wall "Frequencia" with all the words they could use for their partner work.    Marcy Sterlis
1011158,2016,959767,2016-04-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Obercian    I enjoyed observing your classroom today- one thing that struck me during the visit was the increase of Spanish being used (versus previous visits and more of a mix of both Spanish and English) which is a testament to how your students have advanced this year. Students were engaged they enjoyed sharing information about themselves and the magazine appeared to be a "high value" resource- they were very excited to read the articles.     If you review the Danielson rubric specifically Domain 3 the "Highly Effective" indicators focus on the student. For example 3d. "Students self assess and monitor their own progress" 3c. "Students take initiative to improve the lesson by modifying..." and 3b. "Students extend the discussion enriching it...." If you are interested in exploring how this lesson (or activities) could have been more "student-centered" I'd be happy to support you.    Sincerely    Marcy
1011158,2017,1095154,2016-11-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Obercian    I enjoyed observing you implement a "Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling" assessment.  Students were motivated to set and meet new individual goals and you were able to check their understanding of the vocabulary learned in "Tumba."      Sincerely    Marcy Sterlis
1019780,2014,21850,2013-09-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Next Steps: Ms. Evers as we move through this year as a department it is important that certain questions stay in the forefront of your planning.     Why is it important for students to be engaged in self-assessment and peer assessment?  Why is it important to form questions and assessments that help diagnose evidence of learning?  Why would it be beneficial for students to engage in discussions with the teacher stepping out of the central role into a mediating role?    Please feel free to meet with me so that we can continue this conversation and together look at ways to implement the next steps.
1019780,2014,193954,2014-02-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Evers I would like to take this opportunity to comment you on the work being done in you classrooms. You have established a culture for learning maintaining of accurate records and the communicating with families.    The area that I will be given an opportunity to see during future observation would the engaging of the students in learning at the next level. Do you have activities for each lesson or are most lessons lecture style teaching? Please take a look at Danielson Rubric 3 (c).
1019780,2014,295360,2014-03-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,7,Formal Observation Cycle,STANISLAUS GREGORY,You have established an environment of respect and rapportand a culture for learning through your instruction and planning and preparation.     While I was observing your lesson I had the opportunity to speak with some of your students. They expressed that they really enjoyed the activity but would like to have more activities and less direct teaching. We all realize that direct teaching holds an important role in the teaching experience but it is important to have hands on activities as often a s possible. It increases the level of student engagement.    If any artifacts are needed I will inform you if it has not been covered by the lesson plan you turned in to me.    Thank you for your commitment to your students and science department.
1019780,2014,467591,2014-05-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the class observation for May 222014.    How do you present assignments and directions in multiple formats including text pictures  film and audio?    Thank you for another year of dedicated and commitment service to our students.
1019780,2015,538955,2014-10-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms Evers    I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the work that you do for your students and the entire school building. You add knowledge to ever conversation to help build a strong and safe school. As the lead teacher in the urban advantage program we will continue to seek opportunities to help your students increase their level of in class hands on activities. i would also like to discuss planning some class trips to enhance the learning experience.     Mr. Greg Stanislaus
1019780,2015,559364,2014-12-10 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Evers    Thank you so much for inviting me into this lesson.  The curriculum connection to Social Studies was evident and the students I spoke to were able to see the connections as well.    Wonderings:  How were the groups created?  The students were working well together and the groups were on task but I noticed that some were more creative than others and I was wondering if those groups possibly contained more visual art students than the less creative groups.  I know that this was the start of a larger unit please work on "deepening" the questions and discussions when using the maps that were created in class today.
1019780,2015,683966,2015-04-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Evers  I enjoyed your class on radioactive decay/half-life to estimate fossil age and the overview of chemistry basics with class 711.  Although this is a challenging and abstract concept you were able to connect basic atomic properties to understanding isotopes and half-life so that students can understand how scientists estimate the age of fossils.  Students offered their knowledge of atoms and asked several questions (as did you) to help you assess their understanding.  The demonstration you used connected to the activity/assessment in the book and used math to help students understand the greater concept of half-life.  Next Steps:  In your research of great lessons and activities continue to try your best at finding hands-on approaches to making 'abstract' science come to life!  Please let me know if there are other resources on your wish list to make this happen.  Thanks for your hard work and dedication to your students!
1019780,2015,769778,2015-05-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Evers    Thank you for your commitment to the Science Department.This year before your unfortunate accident you were continuing to be the lead teacher in the science department in the Urban Advantage curriculum. You have continued to work on growing in content knowledge. You have always been willing to share and lead our department in discussions during the professional development mondays. The latest has been to align the writing of labs with the terminology and writing in the ELA classes. You are instrumental to our department and school. I wish you a speedy recovery and have a great summer.     Thank you    Mr. G Staniskaus
1019780,2016,789052,2015-10-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Evers    Thank you for the  opportunity to visit your classroom. How did you evaluate how the activities and /or the assignments promote student thinking?I want to commend you for having the students engage in activities that supported your lecture.  Moving forward we will focus on questioning and discussion techniques.    Thank You    Mr. G Stanisaus
1019780,2016,840338,2015-12-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Evers  It was a pleasure to visit your class (605) and see them working on their "mass/measurement lab."  Students worked in groups to measure the mass of 4 cylinders (rice beans rice krispies and empty).  In a previous lesson they had made observations sketches and predictions about the mass of each item and how they compared.  Students worked cooperatively taking turns to measure and helping each other in the calculations.  One group finished early and you were able to give them a challenge question to work on as a group that would push them ahead in finding volume and ultimately density.  Next Steps:  Consider providing higher level thinking questions at the end of the activity especially when doing a procedural lab so that students can better connect the data to the greater concept.  Post-lab questions promote critical thinking to process the information and data collected especially for those students who finish early.  Questions can start lower on the DOK scale (Was your prediction correct?) and move on to higher cognitive thinking questions that would connect mass and volume to the greater concept of density.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication!
1019780,2016,901048,2016-02-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Evers    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. Although you have been dealing with health concerns you are still engaging your students in meaningful conversations and discussions. The level of respect and rapport in the room is very high and your expectations are understood by your students. Students benefit greatly from activity based lessons especially when they have learning challenges. Please review the questions below.    How do you group students and why?  How is your lesson organized to advance student learning and why?  How do you provide students with feedback on their progress?  How often do you conduct activities/hands on in your class?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
1019780,2016,957367,2016-03-31 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Evers    Thank you for allowing me to visit your classroom. Your room environment is positive and students are supported in their learning. Although direct teaching is important having student engaged in discussions lead by students allowes them to express ideas and thoughts with one another. I do thank you for setting up several lab activities for your students.     How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  What criteria or tools did you use to craft your questions?  How do you use discussion amongstudents?Why?    Thank you  Mr.G. Stanislaus

You have established a positive learning environment for your students. You have prepared you students for the 7th grade curriculum by doing a through review of basic concepts.It is important that we continue to give  our students opportunities with many hands on activities. I believe the best model is the one that we use that starts off with a short introductory direct teach followed by inquiry hands on labs and activities. Thank you for all that you do with your students. Review the questions below.    What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?  How do you connect pair group and class discussions to writing and /or opportunities to extend thinking?    Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus

Your students were having a great experience with the activity. Both you and your co teacher were able to bring two important subjects together Math and Science.   A few questions to think about.  How do you know that all students met the learning target?  How do you provide students with feedback on their progress?  In your lesson how did you and your co teacher group your students and why?  Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus

Students were engaged in a "walkabout" solving a wide variety of problems (50) that were posted all over the room.  In a world were students often sit too much it was a refreshing approach to solving math problems!  Students were expected to answer approximately 10-15 in the period they could choose out of 50 work in groups partnerships or individually.  Students used calculators as needed which you placed around the room.  In the last few minutes as students found their seats you challenged them with a few problems and highlighted important concepts.  Students were not afraid to come to the board to share their problem solving techniques or to ask questions.  You reminded them that you are available for help after school.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
1027469,2017,1071093,2016-10-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Cohen    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. Your class was exciting and all of the students were caught up in the lesson of the day. You have demonstrated the ability to get all of your students regardless of their learning style involved in the activity. Take a moment to consider the questions below.    How do you ask questions that made students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?    Thank you
1035320,2014,43885,2013-11-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,This was truly a wonderful lesson and your students are so lucky to have you as their math teacher!    One thing to try: during the last part of the lesson when you clarified a common question your students were raising during the activity check that they understood your point by either using an "exit card" asking What does 300 mean in this problem?  Or a simple "turn and tell your partner about the part to whole etc."  This last request of yours may be what helps the students process the most important piece of information that will bring them to the solution and understand the concept.  Also when calling on students consider using a more random approach to increase accountability such as the "popsicle method."    As I noted during the class I would love to see the wonderful work produced by your students on your classroom walls and bulletins boards outside.  It should be celebrated!      Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!

Students took this job very seriously as they worked on each other's problems before moving forward in the activity.  Students were able to explain to me what they were doing and why this was important to them.  It was a pleasure to visit your lesson today.  Your room is always filled with colleagues- there to watch and learn!  Thank you for being a leader and supporting your team with excellent lessons and the courage to always try new strategies with your students.  You dedication is unwavering.

This assessment was  differentiated for the various learners in the ICT class. Both you and Ms. Farrell were moving around  the room to check in as the students were working while Mr. K was passing out the calculators. You then reviewed the "quiz" with the students. Mr. K took 1 student to work with him while you worked with the majority of the group and Ms. Farrell conferenced with students who based on the initial assessment needed additional clarification.  This was a wonderful example of ICT teams at their best. Please invite your colleagues into the room to  share in your success.  Teacher's

This was a very engaging student-centered approach to review concepts and prepare students for an upcoming test.  Students had an opportunity to review several questions complete problems teach problem solving to other studentsand self-assess and set study goals.  Students completed many problems and taught classmates how to solve problems.  Colleagues watched the lesson to observe your innovative pedagogical approach.    Next Steps:  Continue to provide opportunities and discussion questions in order to increase student conversations around math problem solving and explaining their thinking.    Thank you for your dedication to the MS 51 community.
1035320,2016,832213,2015-12-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Greenawalt    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class The combination of a math and science lesson was amazing. All of your students were engaged and involved in healthy discussion that was supported by both you and your co teacher.   How do you develop and ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?    Thank you     Mr. G Stanislaus
1035320,2016,995082,2016-05-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Greenawalt    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. Your students are being prepared for the future in many ways. The study skills that you are teaching along with the content supports their learning. You have manage to really know the learning styles of your students and work to support them in many ways.     Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
1035320,2017,1104604,2016-11-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Greenawalt  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade accelerated math class as they were starting a new unit on Percentages.  Students were learning the steps - which were very clear and simple - to strategically approach the solving of Percentage problems and you demonstrated a few 'benchmark' examples with the class.  You told students to take a moment to write down "what you need that is helpful to you" from the notes on the board suggesting that they have the maturity and are responsible enough to decide what they need to help them master the work.  Students then had time to practice several problems (from the homework sheet).  Your goal was clearly to have them 'warm up' to the new unit by practicing simpler problems that would help them use their 'mental math' abilities as a foundation in order to build up to harder problems.  You also asked them to create a percentage problem with context and then trade it with a partner to solve each other's word problem.  Students came up with crafty word problems to challenge one another.  I also enjoyed seeing the students' hexiflexigons.  Many were still talking about their videos and making more than one kind.  The project was creative challenging and fun - and involved the whole family as well as technology!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students and your craft.

This has allowed you to get to really know the students and their learning needs.  Since last year you have used a technique to calm  the class before starting. Although it has changed to some degree you have been able to create and environment of respect and rapport.   Throughout the lesson you have been able to engage your students and continuously used different strategies to assess them.     Growth:  Over the past two years you have developed several templates for collecting data on students to determine their academic growth. I would like to meet with you to see and discuss those templates.     As a dept. we will work to develop our questioning and discussion techniques. We will continue to work to challenge students cognitively and advance to high level thinking.     I have information on this topic that I will forward to you. After looking over please set up a time to meet with me. Thank You

Nest Steps:  Work with your co-teacher in planning open-ended questioning and discussion techniques to support the learning in your room.  More than just operations questions students can discuss the concepts and even write about math in a meaningful way.  Or students can simply discuss ways in which they solved a problem and justify their reasoning or use their solution as evidence to support their reasoning.  Thank you for your dedication and hard work.

This note-taking system provides a great skill for recording questioning reflecting and learning information from one's notes - a skill they can use in high school college and beyond.  Plus using these methods from class to class really helps students apply skills.  It was also great to see math students learning the historical context around the math and about the mathematicians whose theories live forever.  Students were highly engaged in the reading (which was simple enough for all to grasp) and were comfortably using this note-taking system to complete the activity.  You told students that after 15 minutes they would share their questions/notes using the 'throw the ball' method of calling on students holding them accountable and helping you to check for understanding.    Thank you so much for your dedication to your students and for strategically planning with your team.
1080044,2015,740138,2015-05-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Farrell    When I came into the class the students were taking a quick assessment.

You were able to establish classroom procedures that are supported by the students.    Growth  As a department our goal is for the teacher to pose questions which you do not know the answers to. The purpose is to promote student thinking and discussion.     Next Steps:  1. I would like for you to contact Ms. Morris to get access to the math resources in the basement. I will visit your class the week of Dec. 16th and would like to see the use of manipulatives during the lesson.  2. We should meet to discuss the different strategies of grouping the students. I will also forward you tools that could prove supportive to developing groups in the classroom.    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class.

Students are involved in the classroom management and behavior. Your work with the paraprofessionals proves to be of a great benefit to your students.    Next Steps:  Over the next two weeks I would like for you to review the Danielson Rubric 3(b) on questioning and discussion techniques.   Also when students are finished answering a question they could be asked to give themselves a grade based on the rubric. They could also be asked why they gave that response and could critique the work of other students.  I will contact you when I plan to come into your class again.  Thank you for your continued growth and dedication.

You should make that part of your daily routine!  Next Steps:  1e - Designing Coherent Instruction:  What was the Big Idea in this unit?  What is your Essential Question and Learning Target for the lesson?    Please take the time to plan a lesson that is engaging aligned to CCLS higher on the Depth of Knowledge wheel and that supports many kinds of learners. In this lesson students were stuck with no where to go when they couldn't define the words.  The resource of papers you gave them from when they first saw the movie was mostly incomplete.    Create a lesson with multiple entry points and modalities not just auditory and visual.  Have students look at books of fossils or hold actual fossils to observe talk and write about.  Create discussion questions to guide the learning so that students can turn and talk about the topic such as "What is a cast fossil?"  "How is it different from an impression?"  You could create stations to observe sketch talk and write about fossils.  Chart student findings to come up with the definitions.  Science is about touching and observing so that students can connect with the abstract and develop meaning for the these complicated definitions and concepts.

The planning of this lesson was very thoughtful allowing students to first think about what they already know about gathering information before they actually begin research on their topics. Your guided practice questions allowed students to think deeply about their topic.  The activity engaged students in discussions with their peers to brainstorm what they already know about a research method while you conferred with groups to check for understanding.  Students shared out to inform others of their research Advice.  Multiple methods of research will ultimately provide choice and differentiation for the varied learners in your room.  Wonderings:  Will these Advice pages be used by the class as a reference page?  Will these ideas be hung on a chart for students to refer to or is there another plan for this important information?   Thank you for your collaborative efforts and your dedication to your students!

Your lesson was well-planned and executed; pace high level questioning and discussion and sharing ideas allowed students to work independently and collaboratively to find meaning in the poem.  There were many opportunities in the lesson for you to assess and check for understanding. Students were engaged throughout the entire lesson.  Thank you for your thoughtful co-planning collegial collaboration and dedication to your students.

As a culminating event to the book clubs students were pulling together all of their post it notes to create guides/pamphlets for future readers.  Guides included themes questions drawings connections and ideas that would be inserted into book covers for future readers to discover and enhance their enjoyment of the book.  You worked with each of your students to clarify problem solve and plan how they would complete this project. Students were completely engaged working cooperatively with their book club members to complete the guides.  Each guide was incredibly different and students chose a variety of ideas to include in their guides.  Students used their own devices to research quotes and some students were tweeting questions to the author of their book!    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students and for working so cooperatively with your co-teacher and team.

I really enjoyed the presentations the openness of the students in sharing their work.    How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussions among students? Why?    Thank you    Mr. Stanislaus
1114504,2015,681514,2015-04-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,When I entered the room the students were responding to themes in Romeo and Juliet.  Ms. DePalma had a series of questions (5) on the screen which were shown one at a time allowing for the students to reflect and respond in writing.  As the students were writing she moved from table to table to assist and continually reminded the students to elaborate.  She also gave cues to help stretch the answers.  After the final question was answered the students shared in the groups.  Next she asked the students to share as a whole class.  The students expressed opinions and elaborated on prior responses.  The teacher allowed the students to lead the conversation giving prompts where necessary.    Ms. DePalma  This inclusion class was a model of how much can be done with a group of students when two teacher work well together.  Although you were the "lead" in this lesson Ms. Warren was supporting you and it was very easy to see that the lesson and questions were very well planned.  The students were anxious to express opinions and were respectful of each other when doing so.  This was a great insight into how 13 year old children perceive love hate parents etc. and a great start to the study of Romeo and Juliet.  Thank you for allowing me into the lesson.
1114504,2015,702832,2015-05-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. DePalma  I enjoyed visiting your ELA ICT 8th grade class lesson on Romeo and Juliet "True Love or Youthful Rash Behavior" Debate.  Students had self-selected their group based on their belief in whether or not Romeo had found true love was behaving rashly or if they were undecided.  Groups were discussing the issue and completing a graphic organizer for their claim or developing questions if they were undecided.  Students were highly engaged in this process as they prepared for the debate. You followed a debate format that is used by the social studies teacher in the grade team: point counterpoint rebuttals and then questions. Students thought critically about the issues used evidence from the text to present and defend their claim asked clarifying questions and made decisions in the end to answer the debate question.    Thank you so much for your dedication to the ICT team and all your efforts!
1114504,2016,821443,2015-11-19 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. DePalma    Observing your co-taught classroom and seeing the structures you have in place for all learners was exceptional. Pacing was on target and the activities all supported the question "How can I revise my claim to make it stronger?"   If you review the Danielson continuum to move from "Effective" to "Highly Effective" in the areas of "Questioning and discussion techniques" and "Using assessment in instruction" the difference is teacher directed vs. student directed- for example "students initiate higher order thinking" and "students have helped establish evaluation criteria." If either of these are areas that you would like to focus on I'd be happy to support you with them.    I look forward to observing your classroom again.    Sincerely    Marcy
1114504,2016,833741,2015-12-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. DePalma  I observed your writing class with 810 as they were in the midst of revising their essays by adding transition words and phrases.  Your co-planning included three stations and you shared the work with your co-teacher and student teacher.  Students had been assessed and groups created based on the assessment of their essay draft.  All students were working on adding transitions and the three groups spanned from sophistated revisions to identifying and adding basic transitions.  You worked with a small group than ranged in levels and each student was productive in adding transitions to their essay guided by your prompts and resources.  Human resources were well utilized by your team in meeting the needs of all your students.  Next Steps:  Continue to plan lessons that incorporate station and parallel teaching most of the time.  Check out the website www.coteach.com and the book "The Power of 2" by Marilyn Friend.  She is a leader in the world of ICT teaching and a great resource.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

The two teachers work seamlessly together.  In this lesson you were checking in with students and taking notes while the other teacher read aloud (this was part of a series of lessons in a social action writing unit) and started the question prompts.    The class broke into stations for discussion groups and students were given a choice of articles.    The team teaching in the room is a model for other teams to follow.  The evidence of co-planning is obvious as is the mutual respect that is modeled for the students.  Thank you for this lesson.

Please be sure to have a reflection piece.  You might want to consider an exit slip or a rubric that could be student created to assess the student's personal success with the lesson/skill.  Also be sure that students move backpacks into one area when working in low lighting in order to maintain safety.

I also commend you for your work with the student teacher.  Whenever I come into your room I am amazed by the independence you give to the students and your ability to "assess on the fly" to help a student improve his/her photographic skills.

They created the prints and presented them for review.  The darkroom is a wonderful learning opportunity for the students.  The organization that is present to run two rooms at the same time is an example for teachers in every dicipline.
1114751,2015,622972,2015-02-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Amy  Your 7th grade lesson on photographing sci/fi/horror and old hollywood images using modifiers costumes mirrors lighting and props is made only more exciting by having it in the black box theater!  Students enjoyed working in various roles as teams completed these photos; roles included model photographer and students working with the props and lighting modifiers.  You checked for understanding of the major concepts with your questions and retaught concepts that seemed unclear.  Students were entirely engaged in the process of creating these images as a team.  Thank you for your dedication to your students!

What are the criteria for assessing the students' work?  How do the students know the assessment criteria?  How do you provide students with feedback on their progress?    Great Class.    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
1114751,2015,693276,2015-04-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Students were working on "grain" in photography.  The project board was displayed for students to refer to during the lesson.  The discussion was centered around "shutter speed" and "stop-action".  The students were preparing to use the digital lab and the contact sheets that they had created to self select pieces to use.  They also worked with each other to edit and critique selections.     Ms. Flatow    The students were very animated while discussing the project and the work that they had already started.  The rubric for self-assessment and peer feedback was clearly understood.  Your ability to work with a digital lab and a darkroom is amazing.  The students take ownership of the activity and are fully engaged in the work.  i look forward to the completed project.  Thank you.
1114751,2015,742460,2015-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Flatow    When I entered the 6T2 class the students were working on a project.  The students were retrieving work from the class drawer conferencing with you at your desk selecting negatives to print and using the darkroom.  The students were working together to edit the photo choices and review contact sheets.  The students were well aware of the rubric being used for the project and set his/her own goal for the class time.  The students were fully engaged in the work and were excited to explain what they were doing.    Your organization and ability to manage both of the class areas is wonderful.  Thank you for allowing me to come into the class.
1114751,2016,843139,2015-12-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Flatow    This was a new unit "Autobiographical Portrait;Beyond the Selfie".  You had a rubric for the unit and clear goals for the students.  You began the lesson with a warm up activity focusing on what students are and are not about as individuals.  The students were able to share and the group discussion was lively.      I look forward to the completed project and seeing what the students are able to accomplish photographically as well as the written work.    Thank you for sharing this class with me.
1114751,2016,913888,2016-02-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Flatow  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade photography section.  Students were learning how organize and start their new project.  In your lesson you reviewed the requirements of the project and how to print contact sheets and choose their best 'slow' and 'fast' pictures.  You were incredibly organized which helped your students get organized for the project - complete with Project Board instructions computers for every student personal binders and orchestrating the flow of the room.  After you answered a few questions students were able to work collaborately and individually on selecting their photos creating and printing their contact sheets and selecting their best photos.  Some students worked in the dark room and you assisted students as needed.  Students worked at their own pace.    Your space is a creative environment with music playing and creative juices flowing!  Thank you for your passion for photography and dedication to your students!
1114751,2016,945945,2016-03-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Flatow    When I entered the room you were working with the group of students by the window and discussing the yearbook while other students were working on projects (individually and collectively) either in the darkroom or the digital lab.  The students served as resources for each other and they spoke about the project using the rubric as a reference point.  You conferenced individually with the students and helped to direct the students who were having drop box issues to a resolution.  This class is a joy to observe.  The students are motivated the rubrics are clear and the student choice is evident.  Thank you for modeling a student directed learning environment so wonderfully.    I look forward to returning to the class in late April to observe the final products before the showcase.    Thank you.
1114751,2016,1007325,2016-05-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Flatow    This lesson was wonderful.  The students were working in the digital lab to create his/her on-line personal portfolio.  This portfolio will be a tool for the grade 7 students in the high school application process as well as a presentation of the work that they have accomplished with your guidance.  The lesson was structured the rubric and timeline was posted the students clearly understood the work to be done and you provided support and assistance when needed.    The connections to the writing process was wonderful and really shows how art is connected to all other areas of learning.  Thank you for the great lesson.
1114751,2017,1102397,2016-11-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Flatow    When I entered the Grade 6 Photo class students were working in the digital lab while you were assisting other students in the darkroom.  The students explained to me the process that they were using to make negatives and positives.  They were assisting each other in critiquing the images that they had obtained using a pin hole camera.  The students were able to explain what they were doing and the next steps that they had to take in order to complete the assignment.  The students were excited and proved themselves very capable.  This demonstrated the time that was taken to establish classroom procedures and safety routines in a working "lab".  When you rejoined this group to check in the transition was smooth and the students in the darkroom were able to complete the assignment as well.    Thank you for an enjoyable introduction to pin hole photography.

Next steps.     As a school community we are working to enhance the Danielson Rubric 3(b). I is important that questioning and discussion be used as techniques to deepen students understanding rather than serve as recitation. I would like for you to review the rubric and pose questions designed to promote student thinking and understanding.   I will forward templates to help you formulate highly effective questions. I will visit your class during the week of Feb. 10 2014
1121437,2014,105448,2014-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),SPETH NANCE,The rubric for assessment was missing.  The students stated that they would receive it later.  In order for the students to self correct within the group it would be beneficial for the rubric to be displayed or distributed during the initial stage of the project rather than for a final review.
1121437,2014,275294,2014-03-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Both you and you co-teacher have been able to establish an environment of respect and rapport and a culture for learning. Your knowledge of your students and the resources available continues to help move them to their full learning potential.    I will set a meeting time this week 4/28/14 to discuss the artifacts needed to complete your annual evaluation.    thank you for the opportunity to visit your class.
1121437,2014,485183,2014-04-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for April 1 2014.    How do you assist the students that seem to resist you help in class?

Both you and your co-teacher have worked together to deliver a supportive educational experience for all of your students.     Thank you for your commitment and dedication.     Please view the site below on 3B. Questioning and discussion techniques.This will be a focus for upcoming observations.
1121437,2015,502522,2014-10-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Hesdra    Thank you for allowing me to come to your class while they were working on the project in the library.  All of the adults in the room were working together to help the children complete the projects and navigate the internet to learn how to do authentic research.  The students were engaged and helpful to each other.    Wonderings:  How did you change the rubric and or the project outline for the IEP students to differentiate the lesson?      Thank you for the teamwork and the support that you give to all of the students in 703.
1121437,2015,600577,2014-12-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Hesdra    I would like to thank you for allowing me to visit your class. You have continued to grow as an educator. i will set up a time to meet to discuss using assessments in Instruction. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.    Thank you     Greg Stanislaus.
1121437,2015,663743,2015-03-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Hesdra    Thank you for the opportunity to visit with you and your students. I would like for you to think about the following questions?    What were the criteria for assessing the students work?  How do you ask students questions that make them think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?    Thank you     Mr. G Stanislaus
1121437,2015,681461,2015-04-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Hesdra  I enjoyed your introductory lesson on writing about a revolutionary war battle in a news-style format with class 703.  Informational writing is a key standard of the Common Core and connects to our instructional focus of incorporating writing in content areas.  Your handouts scaffolded the outline of the task and provided a model for student's writing.  You and your co-teacher clearly communicated the overview of the task as this was the first day of a new learning target.  Although many of your questions were low level to identify the elements of a news article the greater discussion questions regarding the revolutionary war battles and how to create an historically accurate article with evidence/research and journalistic flair (with some fiction) started their thinking and discussion about the greater task at hand.  Students had time to read samples and analyze the elements of a newspaper type article.    Wonderings:  Could you ask more probing questions to assess prior knowledge?  Many students may have a good working knowledge of elements of a news article and may not have needed a full mini lesson on this.  To better engage students some could have worked ahead on labeling the parts and then start reading about the battles or read other examples while others may need to spend the whole period going over the elements of news writing.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
1121437,2016,832384,2015-12-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Kim    I enjoyed observing you co-teach today; it was great to see your students engage in a lively discussion on the colonies and mercantilism and I appreciated how you included learning opportunities for the auditory and visual learners.    As discussed following your observation I would like to observe you in a different co-teacher role other than "one teach one assist" so please let me know when would be a good time to come in and observe another class.    Sincerely    Marcy
1121437,2016,895960,2016-02-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Hesdra    I enjoyed observing your classroom today; you provided students with various activities to access and understand the content and they were clearly enthusiastic about it (the informal debate).     To move from "Effective" to "Highly Effective" in the area of 3c. you might consider planning  activities that help all of your students (not just a few) achieve the same level of engagement and engage in critical thinking skills.    Sincerely      Marcy
1121437,2016,918317,2016-03-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Thank you for allowing me to observe this class.  The students were working together as the two teachers were posing questions and circulating within the room.  The study of the Witch Trials of Salem is always a student favorite.  You took the opportunity to create a cross-curricular study as well as requiring the students to focus on evidence. I found it wonderful to watch you work with Ms. Solomon and trade the lead role.  This was a very interesting lesson.
1121437,2016,938447,2016-03-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Hesdra  It was a pleasure to visit your social studies class as they learned about the French and Indian War.  In your minilesson you provided a study guide and forecasted the class and homework for the next week.  Your guide listed 5 major areas to study where to find the information (notes handouts articles political cartoons) and the skills required (ex: how to read and interpret a political cartoon).  The guide required a parent signature to increase parent engagement and partnering.  You also told students to use the next 5 days to organize this information for studying study each night ask questions each day leading up to the test and to visit you at office hours on Wednesday.  Previewing and uploading this information one week in advance in extremely helpful to students and parents especially for those SWD.  The lesson continued with a KWL chart using their notes and partner talk to activate prior knowledge of the French and Indian War.  Next Steps:  Continue to plan with your co-teacher so that you can 'preview' content with your IEP students so that they can better access their social studies content within each unit and participate even more.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1158211,2014,135368,2014-02-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,7,Formal Observation Cycle,DILEO BERNER LENORE,You clearly met your learning objectives in this lesson as students learned about reading complex text and tone in poetry.    Next Steps:  -For high-achieving students who quickly answered the critical thinking questions plan even higher-level thinking questions so that they can deepen their work and you can push them to make more progress.  -How do you track your students?  You provided many checks for understanding but I wasn't sure what your system is for keep ing track of that student information.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1158211,2014,289307,2014-05-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Kaspryzyk  It was a pleasure to see your reading lesson today.  You line of questioning provided many opportunities for your students to think critically about the fairy tale.  You consistently give your students time to turn and talk with their peers and to self-assess their ideas.   Thank you for your dedication to meeting the needs of your students.
1158211,2014,355921,2014-05-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Liza  It was a pleasure to see your 7th graders reading independently during your silent reading period. Since this was the third period you saw this class today (one entailed going on a trip to B&N to buy books!)it was very good planning to have them reading in the afternoon!  Students were actively engaged in reading or working with you before they settled into their book.  Thank you for creating a culture around reading that excites students and promotes reading stamina.
1158211,2014,376987,2014-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Kaspryzk  Students were engaged in creating an accurate reading schedule for all club members - a task which involved team work and math skills as they calculated a fair reading schedule that would coincide with planned meeting times.  The basis of the books clubs the reading schedule is vital teaches responsibility among club members and will ensure great book club discussions.  Thanks!

Students had previous instruction and scaffolding around how to research their argument essay topics online in the lab and came with their completed handouts as a support.  Being well-prepared allowed for efficient and effective use of the space.  Students self-selected topics that included school start times sexism and careers death penalty dress codes fast food and standardized testing just to name a few.  You managed the students use of the lab as well as the roles of the other adults in the room so that all students had support and access to the technology and learning.    Thank you for your dedication to your students and this important work.

Your lesson was well planned and took students through an analogy of how good ideas and book club discussion questions can be ranked liked a 'hierarchy' from poor to really strong for the best possible discussion.  You asked students to go back to their diagrams of ideas/themes and analyze and challenge their quality and to come up with even richer ideas and questions about their book.  As you visited each group you could assess the level of their conversations and whether or not they were accomplishing the lesson's goals.  You and your coteacher were able to facilitate this work at each group for your wide variety of learners.  Next Steps  To push your students even further in the share ask a group member or two to recap what they accomplished in the activity.  If a student can articulate at least one idea or question that they challenged or added to their diagram and why you know that you have met your learning target (see target in 1a).  Thank you for your dedication and hard work!  Your student readers and writers are growing and learning everyday!

Both teachers were conferencing with students.  When you completed a conference you went to check in with a group in the front of the room and spotted a student that needed additional help you then conferenced with him to clarify poetic language.  This conference helped the student learn a new skill and improve his writing for the project.    Please allow other teachers to visit your room to see how your team conferences with individual students.    I look forward to seeing the final results of the project.

You have shown a dedication to your students that has prepared them for the next level of their educational experience. Consider the following questions as you move forward.     How do you ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?    Mr. Stanislaus
1158211,2016,871218,2016-01-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Liza    It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade ELA ICT class as they were working together to consider their ideas for their research question/argument writing. The class-made web provided a large assortment of topics and students used a graphic organizer to select a few ideas and begin the process of narrowing them down to one.  Students were successfully using the graphic organizer you provided to come up with research questions.  Students had selected incredibly interesting topics on education social justice and other real-world controversial issues to begin the work of research and claim-based writing.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to meeting the needs of all your students.
1158211,2016,874068,2016-01-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,This lesson with the Grade 7 ICT class was conducted in the computer lab.  The goal of the lesson (which is part of a multi-day plan) is that the students will be able to identify a credible source.  In prior lessons the students discussed the internet and how to look at entries to assess credibility.    The students were given a graphic organizer and 5 different web sites.  Working in pairs they were to view each site and evaluate the credibility of the site.  The students were focused and the conversations were rich with information.  The teachers moved to every group.    Ms. Kasprzyk    Your choice to use cloning as the topic for the students really held the attention of the groups.  The students were looking at the sources the dates the article was updated the references for the authors as well as many other areas that they thought were concerning.    S:"..which is the one that is updated?" S2:"This one (points)" S1:" ...there is no factual information...look..."  S2:"...went to this other web site...I could have done that ...don't think it is true"  S:"..look dot gov means it is checked...this is better..."  The students took great joy in finding grammar or spelling errors.  This is an important lesson for our tech students and helps then become more critical of what is written by others.  Thank you for inviting me to this class.
1158211,2016,965096,2016-04-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,7,Formal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Kasprzyk  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade ICT ELA class as you were introducing the poetry unit.  What a great unit to start after a grueling week of state exams in ELA!  Students began by thinking about the similarities and differences between poetry and music using a venn diagram.  After working on this independently students shared their ideas with their tablemates adding new ideas to their charts.  Then they shared with the whole class and you acknowledged their excellent thinking work.  In your minilesson you made a connection between music and poetry and asked students to think further about how they both make you feel imagine and maybe not all of them are likeable but that you would help them find a favorite poem by the end of the unit.  Then you gave them another organizer to use for the main activity.  You played them a song and asked them to write down what they visualized and how the song made them feel.  After each song and jotting of ideas students shared with their tablemates and then with the whole group.  Highlights:  Students had multiple opportunities to think critically about music and poetry and think critically and discuss the visualization and emotions they felt with each piece of music.  Students had insightful interpretations for every song!  Students were provided graphic organizers typed lyrics and word lists of emotions to support their thinking work and discussions.  You and your co-teacher and para assessed learning by listening to discussions reading their organizers and allowing groups to share their work.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.  What a great way to excite students as you launch this new reading/writing unit on poetry!
1158211,2016,969653,2016-04-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Kasprzyk    Your lesson today was highly engaging. Students were motivated and you provided them with access to the content.     Bravo!    Marcy
1158303,2015,607135,2014-12-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Kalinkos    Thank you so much for opening up your class to me. I really enjoyed the lesson taught on "Ratios". I will visit your next math meeting to see how things are going and to be able to see first hand to see the growing and professional development taking place.    Thank you    Mr.G Stanislaus
1158303,2015,579124,2015-01-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Maria  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade math class.  Your lesson had an excellent pace and provided students many opportunities to practice proportions and percents using "markup" word problems independently with their table mates and with your feedback.  To save time and manage limited technology you provided students with ready-to-go handouts for each aspect of the lesson - HW lesson activity and the do-now.    Next Steps:  When appropriate consider using additional resources (manipulatives/visuals) student choice of problems or connections to other disciplines.  Also consider developing more math problems and critical thinking questions that can engage students in problem solving discussions and team work.    Thank you for being a key member of your math team.  Your contributions are greatly appreciated.  I also appreciate your enthusiasm in participating in after school Mastery Connect and network PD.
1158303,2015,681642,2015-04-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Kalinkos    Thank you for allowing me to observe your math lesson today.  The students were working together as you were demonstrating a problem on the projector.  You then moved to each group to check in and questioned the students about the thinking on various problems.  When you saw an issue with one specific problem you moved to the screen to demonstrate how to solve the problem step by step with the students providing the information.      Wondering:    Do the students have a rubric for classwork (group work)?  How are the groups formed?
1158303,2015,739948,2015-05-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,7,Formal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Maria  You are an excellent planner; your lesson plans are quite thorough allowing you to plan many lessons at once ensuring coherency and sequencing of information.  Your review of the homework allowed you to assess students and students were able to review their work get your feedback and ask questions. Your activities some independent and some collaborative asked students to activate prior knowledge and develop complex ideas around quadrilaterals and their characteristics.    Next Steps:  Consider completing the conceptual graphic in a group activity so that students could grapple with the concepts debate ideas with classmates question one another and use evidence to prove why they think each statement is true or false. Then the groups could share out why they have completed the graphic the way they did - ultimately you would need to facilitate and reinforce the accurate completed graphic. Although this would take more time students may understand the concepts more deeply.  It was a pleasure to visit your math class with 712.  Thank you so much for your dedication to your students.
1158303,2016,861375,2015-11-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Kalinkos    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Your students are benefiting greatly from the learning environment you have nurtured in your classroom. Students seem to understand what is expected of them and live up to the standards you set for them. On my next visit I will look and focus on effective questioning and discussion techniques.Think about the following questions.    How do you ask questions that made students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?  How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?    Thank You  Mr. G Stanislaus
1158303,2016,838704,2015-12-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Kalinkos  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade math class on Friday period 7.  Students appeared to be following the lesson solving problems and enjoying the share-out of each solution.  Students even cheered when you said you would give them more problems to solve - and they weren't kidding - they were really excited!  Students took risks in explaining how they solved the addition or subtraction of decimals and even word problems and you highlighted students who solved problems in different ways.  You kept students organized with excellent pacing and reminders to keep their notebooks dated and homework assignments copied into their agenda book.    Wonderings:  How do you differentiate for students who are falling behind or may not be keeping up with the classwork?  Will students who are mastering this concept easily be able to move on to the next topic?  Could they be journaling or attempting challenge problems?  Consider a minute or two during the lesson for students to share in partnerships (increase participation and discussion) so more voices are heard and not just those who are brave enough to share out.   Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1158303,2016,924736,2016-02-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Kalinkos    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. Your teaching style has caused many of your students to feel comfortable enough to share their ideas and challenge themselves. You were able to move your students in the direction of the learning goals through a series of questions.You are moving your students toward a higher level of thinking .     How do you connect pair group and class discussions to to extend thinking?  What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?    Thank you   Mr. G Stanislaus
1158303,2016,945153,2016-03-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Kalinkos  It was a pleasure to visit your math lesson with class 611.  Upon entering the room students were asked to take out their homework and complete the do-now.  As you checked homework students sketched the net of the figure and found the surface area.  You reminded students to practice using the fraction key with mixed numbers and then you selected a student to show her work on the board.  You used her work to review the problem and you asked many questions to review the concept of how to find the surface area of prisms and pyramids.  You quickly moved on to the open station activity where students could work at their own pace solving multistep surface area problems by completing the first problem checking the answer on the board and then taking the next problem.  You provided manipulatives to help them visualize the net of the prisms and pyramids and calcuators to help solve the surface area for each.  You asked students to complete and submit the self-assessment checklist of standards once they had completed the first two problems. Students had the challenge to work their way through 6 problems plus two challenge problems.  Many students completed 3-4 of the 6 problems while a few completed all 6 and many took the challenge problems giving themselves homework!    Highlights:  -Students were 100% engaged because each learner at every level had the support they needed with either the manipulatives and calculators or the support of peers teachers and model problems.  -The open-station format allowed students to work at their own pace which was very powerful to watch.  You provided leveled problems and just the right amount for your highest level students to keep engaged while students who worked more slowly could still accomplish several multistep problems successfully.  -Students worked with great independence expectations and accountability.  All the supports in the room allowed them to find solutions without relying too much on the teachers.  Next Steps:  I did notice a couple students working without graph paper.  Let me know if you need a reserve for students who don't have graph notebooks.  I think it is a vital tool especially during this unit.    This was an exceptional lesson!  Please share your best practices with your colleagues!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1158659,2015,562557,2014-11-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Lopex     It was a pleasure to visit your class. As a first year teacher you are demonstrating a willingness to learn and make the greatest impact on your student's learning. I will set up a meeting so that we can discuss the areas of your lesson stated above. I am here to support you as you continue to grow as an excellent teacher.     Mr. Stanislaus
1158659,2015,604203,2015-01-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lopez  I did not see much of a change from the last time I observed your class and gave you feedback about how to improve your lesson.  Please meet with me to discuss your next steps.  Next Steps:  By February 13:   1) Your board should reflect the correct date there should be a learning target do now and agenda for day or instructions about the activity and lesson.  2) For your next observation - plan a lesson that has an activity engaging students in math problems or a science lab that requires critical thinking and learning by 'doing.'  In the textbook you were using there are labs you can modify for your students on page 134.  For example you could have planned a lesson to understand Principle of Superposition by having students label layers and identify ages of rock with different colors of clay or paper. An engaging activity will increase participation and enhance learning.  3) Embarrassing a student over a behavior issue can be humiliating.  Let's work on strategies that help develop a mutual respect and rapport.
1158659,2015,650393,2015-03-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Lopez    I will be setting up a time for us to sit and discuss some of the above concerns.     In what ways have you conveyed to students that you are interested and care about them?  What are some of the ways you convey genuine warmth and caring for your students?  How do you check for student understanding throughout the lesson?  What criteria do you use for assessing the students work?    Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus
1158659,2015,659964,2015-03-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lopez  When I entered your classroom you were projecting a science question onto the smart board "What part of the plant absorbs the light from the sun?"  You read the next slide which gave the answer and a picture of a plant noting "the green leaves of a plant absorb light energy. The plant uses the light energy to make food."  Students looked at the screen and copied the text into their notebooks as you read each slide.  You asked them to try to draw the diagram of photosynthesis.  Wonderings:  Asking students to 'copy' word for word from a textbook or from a screen as the sole activity in a lesson is an activity that is not cognitively engaging students in the content or discussion to learn the content.  "Copying" is not even listed on the Depth of Knowledge chart but I would imagine that it could be added to a Level 1 section with 'draw and label'.  Why not show them a live plant? Or set up stations with microscopes to look at plant cell slides with chloroplasts?  The text vocabulary and diagrams that support the concepts of photosynthesis can be provided on a handout read and annotated and used to provide evidence in explaining the energy cycle or answering discussion questions. Please reach out to your AP mentor and science team to support your lesson planning of each unit and develop stronger lessons for student progress and achievement.
1158659,2015,703761,2015-05-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lopez  It was a pleasure to watch your 8th grade math lesson.  You had an aim on the board "How do we find the missing side of the triangle?  Students worked on solving the missing value of the side of the triangle on a handout of problems.  You had a diagram on the board labeling the parts of the triangle and asked students to highlight the hypotenuse.  You asked students to write the formula a2 + b2 = c2 before each problem they solve and to substitute with values and then calculate.  A few students shared their answers by telling you what to write on the board.  Next Steps:  So that your students can fully understand the concept of the Pythagorean Theorem and understand hypotenuse review these concepts with readings (Ms. Farrell has a simple reading she can share) and discussion.    Create a word wall of these geometry terms so that the students use the proper vocabulary and have a reference they can easily use when needed.    In your plans be sure to include groupings of students for cooperative learning and discussion differentiation and visual or math manipulatives so that students can better grasp these abstract concepts.  Consider observing these students in their other classes to see how they work in groups.    Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1158659,2015,768776,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Lopez    When I entered the room your class was completing the "do now" activity while the adults in the room were distributing the materials needed for the experiment.  The aim was "What determines how a volcano erupts?" and the "do-now" questions were "Why does a volcano erupt?" and "What determines the type of volcano eruption?".  You reviewed the 2 questions and then moved on to the experiment.  When I left the room the students were recording the results of the first trial on the recording sheet.  Thank you for allowing me to observe the experiment.  Wonderings:  How are the students being assessed?  How was the experiment differentiated?  You might want to consider differentiating the recording sheet (rather than having the paraprofessionals explain the sheet to individual students) so that students can accomplish it on his/her own.
1158659,2016,790609,2015-10-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,As discussed in our debrief the lesson observed was an 8th grade math class with three adults and nine students. Students were reviewing math homework problems whole group with you and you were writing answers with chalk on the chalkboard which were very difficult to read from the back of the room.  One student did not have her worksheet and when I asked her where it was she said she lost it. For ten minutes not one adult noticed this.     Recommendations:    Increase the rigor by developing lesson activities that invite students to explain their thinking to their peers and utilize the adults in your classroom to help you achieve this.     Utilize materials that engage students for example manipulatives whiteboards  and technology versus using worksheets and writing answers on the chalkboard with chalk (as discussed you could not read what was written on the board from the back of the room).    Consider implementing a classroom system for positive behaviors. During our discussion you mentioned one student sits alone because he disrupts others or because he does not complete homework assignments (he was not the student that was missing the worksheet) and we brainstormed ways that you can support individuals and the whole class.    Review your Teacher Improvement Plan (TIP) and ensure you are implementing the action steps/activities.
1158659,2016,821684,2015-11-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lopez  Students were working in collaborative groups to answer the question "Does this graph represent a proportional relationship?"  While the classroom was set up to engage students in group work to solve the problems students seemed a bit unsure of the task with few resources to support their thinking.  Each student group was working on the same problems which may have been too easy for some groups and too hard for others.    Next Steps:  Through careful planning develop a series of scaffoled questioning to support problem solving and how to read the graph.  Additional resources (notes glossary manipulatives) could support their independent problem solving.  When you ask a student a question provide sufficient wait time so that they can do the thinking work.  Resist the temptation to give them the answers when they are struggling - instead direct them to resources notes other levels of problems that would lead them to understanding the concept.  While you are on your way to meeting your Fall Tip goals by implementing a collaborative learning environment you need to more thoroughly plan your lessons to include differentiated activities and questioning and discussions that support learning and standards mastery.  Please continue to plan with math team and meet with AP Sterlis to support this work.
1158659,2016,863737,2015-11-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Lopez    Thank you for allowing me to observe your class.The next visit I will announce and we will focus on questioning and discussion techniques. In terms of engaging students in Learning and designing instruction please see the questions below.    How do the activities and /or assignments promote student thinking?  How do the activities and /or the assignments ask students to explain their thinking?  In your lesson how do you group your students and why?  How will the materials and resources support the learning outcomes?    Thank You  Mr. G Stanislaus
1158659,2016,870848,2016-01-12 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,
1158659,2016,909884,2016-02-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lopez  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade SC math class.  Students were working on multi-step rate problems using y=mx+b equations working in groups with like abilities.  They worked on one problem at a time and then shared their answers.  You recorded their answers on chart paper reteaching as you reviewed each step and keeping the work neat and organized to model how to write the answer.  You provided ample wait time for questioning and completing the problems.  Your paras were working with the other three groups and you worked with one group and circulated to others as needed.    Next Steps:  Next Steps to increase engagement and participation:  -You had other instructional charts hanging in your room as a reference - why not create a step-by-step chart to scaffold problem solving steps for those who need the assistance?  Students would be accountable to using this tool while they are working together.  -ask questions that require more crticial thinking; go back to the original word problem/question to see if they can use the solution to make sense of the what the question is asking them to solve.  They should be able to articulate why and how their answer makes sense.  -students are sitting together but not really working together.  Your colleague Mr. Krupitsky can share a tool with you that sets expectations for collaborative student work.  Working and thinking together will help students think critically peer-teach and be accountable to peers for efforts in learning.  Thank you for your continued attention and efforts in making professional gains in pedagogy and conent area knowledge.
1158659,2016,990923,2016-05-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms.Lopez    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. You have created a positive learning environment for your students. All though the lesson all of your students were engaged in the lesson carefully structuring questions can help to guide the students in the lesson. I realized that you gave them information about reproduction but may have held back some of the important information. Preparing a series of questions and anticipating students responses will help develop the lesson and their understanding.    What criteria or tools do you use to craft your questions?  How do you use discussions among students? Why?  What was the criteria for assessing the students' work?  How do you provide students with feedback on thier progress?    Thank you    Mr. Gregory Stanislaus
1209536,2017,1095160,2016-11-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Mark    Thank you for inviting me to your classroom- you and Ms. Singh have created a welcoming inclusive co-taught classroom for all students- and students generating the class rules for literature circles was a great way to start the unit. The "man on the subway" photograph was engaging for all students-  meaningful connections were shared and discussed and I like how you used it to walk students through the steps for literature circle discussions.    Next steps:   Components 3b and 3c: As you continue your unit/s you may want to consider having students create their own questions (e.g. for the literature group discussions) with the goal of engaging them in discourse that promotes their critical thinking skills.    Component 3d: You may want to consider an activity similar to creating literature group rules for assessment- students could create the literature group rubric "...there is some evidence that they have contributed to the assessment criteria" and "Students self-assess and monitor their own progress."    Thank you again- I look forward to returning!    Marcy
1209536,2017,1097954,2016-11-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,7,Formal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Mark    Thank you so much for inviting me to your 6th grade reading lesson on understanding 4 Levels of Questioning to improve discussion in literature circles and ultimately improve reading comprehension.  You reviewed the Essential Question KWL and accountable talk definition to warm up the class and focus their thinking on what they were about to learn.  Students looked at an interesting photograph (great choice!) jotted down questions and then turned and talked with their groups to share their questions.  Students then reviewed the Four Levels of Questioning handout (love the cartoons and names for each) one level at a time and practiced answering the questions using the text King and King with a check and review by you and the whole class. Students were then asked to choose a level of questioning to create their own question at that level share with their group and then submit on a post it.  Next Steps:  To push their thinking further during the lesson instead of just answering questions at each level consider also letting students discuss and practice creating questions at each level within their groups.  Then at the end when you ask them to create a question at the highest level it will force them to think critically and apply what they have learned after practicing with peers - it will also require them to think of another question at the level they choose.    This was an excellent and effective lesson!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!

How was the checklist of guided questions on the screen different from the list you generated from your mini-lesson?    Before you began generating the list of things students noticed about the discussion you and Ms. Villandre modeled you could ask the students to turn and talk about what they noticed first.  This allows all students an opportunity to think speak and share even if they are not called on to share.  Thank you for your tireless dedication and hard work!

When students provided a "not-so-good" revised platitude about their text/media how was that information used for the next activity?  Did you know which students needed extra support based on the previous activity?  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1270912,2014,283315,2014-04-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lang  It was a pleasure to visit your 603 class today.  The class transitions into different groups have become more natural meaningful and effective as the year has progressed.  I look forward to reading the Metropolitan Diaries!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication!
1270912,2014,377071,2014-05-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #1),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lang  It was such a pleasure to see you teach (with special guest!) a lesson on writing a play.  The basic rules and sample were clearly visualized on the screen the demonstration you gave was very engaging and the activity/challenge was also engaging and appropriate. What a great activity for the end of the year!  These will be really fun to read!  Thanks!
1270912,2015,521354,2014-10-30 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lang  Your classroom is an exciting place to learn.  You and your co-teacher have grown in your partnership and your students are enjoying the fruits of your labor!  Students were able to practice identifying character traits after a brief overview of the unit an analysis of a text discussion and power point.  Modifications in the form of reference sheets and graphic organizers provided additional tools for your SWDs.  Next Steps:  I appreciate all that you accomplished in your lesson but felt that more time was needed for students to think about your discussion questions and share their ideas with one another.  They could have used just a little more time to talk and answer the questions during the activity.  Please see the attached information on Learning Targets.  Learning targets are a great way to connect the standard to an "I can" statement that students can understand and know that they accomplished.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!
1270912,2015,705599,2015-05-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Merida  Thank you so much for developing this very special unit around The Outsiders which allowed students to design this wonderful culminating event - a performance of their monologues in the black box theater.  You mentioned to the audience that the students were allowed the creativity to orchestrate how the performance would unfold as well as writing a monologue for a character with which they deeply connected.  Students told the story of the Outsiders through their dramatic monologue performances.  They also scripted chapter summaries wrote playbills costumed the characters advertised around the school with signs and selected music for the background.  This unit rigorously engaged students academically and artistically - they will never forget the meaning and themes of this book!  Thank you for your tireless efforts and your dedication to your craft!
1270912,2015,761554,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Lang    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. Your lessons are filled with the concepts and skills that are central to the content. Your lesson are well planned and very clear to all of your students. Through the activities the content understanding you want your students to learn from the lesson are clear. Thank you for your dedication and i look forward to working with you in the upcoming school year. Have a great summer.    Thank you    Mr. Stanislaus
1270912,2015,768294,2015-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Ms. Lang    The students were engaged in a lesson about writer's craft using poetry.  The poem "Life Doesn't Frighten Me".  You were working with the students to look at the artwork and then moved on to a read-aloud.  This was an ICT class so you presented the material in a variety of ways (auditory visual. etc.).  You scaffolded the lesson and provided supports for the various learners.    Please work with other ICT teams to share your success in scaffolding the lesson for differentiation.    Thank you for allowing me to be a part of the lesson.
1270912,2016,866037,2015-12-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. lang    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. Your team work with your co teacher stands as an example to others. All of your students were given the opportunity to contribute to the lesson. The class organization is evidence of amny hours of palnning and implementaion. Below are a few questions to consider in terms questioning ans discussion techniques.     What criteria or tools did you use to craft your questions?  In what ways did the use of questioning successfully support students' mastery of the objective? how do you know?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
1270912,2016,875185,2016-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Lang  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade reading lesson as students used the "notice and think" chart to highlight various craft moves made by the author.  You reviewed the craft moves and modeled close reading thinking-aloud about why the author made certain craft decisions (short sentences for example) and students made inferences and kept the discussion going with your subtle prompts.  Students continued to add to your thinking-aloud and you highlighted how what they were noticing and thinking was making them more advanced readers.  Students' comments were insightful ("first person wrtiting helps us feel the character's feelings" and "I read another book by Jacqueline Woodson where she used the same craft.")  These comments elevated the conversation.  I was also impressed by the level of stamina of your students as shown by their level of engagement as we were coming to the end of a double period on a Friday!  Next Steps:  To further increase their stamina for this kind of thinking work eventually allow them to listen to longer chunks of the text write and share their thinking with partners with less prompting from you.  I think many of your students may be ready for that shift and perhaps smaller groups could work separately at a slower pace.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students!

You had an example projecting and had a brief discussion with the class.  The students then read diary entries and discussed each in the groups.  You instructed the students to "turn and share your findings".  The students shared and you noted on the board.    The pieces that were chosen were very interesting and lead to some wonderful ideas by the students.  Your co-teacher was working with students who needed one-on-one attention which allowed you to move to larger groups.  This team of teachers seems to function well together with the ICT class.  Thank you for allowing me to be a part of the lesson.
1272028,2014,78354,2013-12-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,Next Steps:  Think like a 6th grader - (1c)in your planning anticipate the types of questions and struggles they will encounter so that you can tailor the lesson around these issues.  For example students were confused as to what numbers they were actually graphing.  In your lesson aside from reviewing the graphing skills help students understand why they were graphing these numbers how it related to the lab and what it will help communicate.
1272028,2014,88826,2013-12-31 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Strengths:    Both you and the second teacher in the room seemed to work well together. Between the both of you all students were made clear on expectations. You have been able to establish a level of respect and rapport in the classroom.   You ensured that all students were engaged in the activity and was able to conference and give individual attention when needed.     Next Steps:    As a dept. we will continue to develop our questioning and discussion techniques. When you do get a chance please take a look at the 3b. rubric in Danielson. I will forward you information on 3b during the week of 1/13/2014. Please feel free to contact me to discuss how together we can challenge students in high level thinking and discourse.    Thank you so much for your dedication and commitment to your students.

In order to complete your annual evaluation I am asking that you turn in an artifact to support 4a. Reflecting on Teaching.    In addition I will visit your class again to observe 3b. Questioning and discussion techniques.    Thank you for your commitment and dedication to your students.
1272028,2014,463708,2014-05-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for May 22 2014.      How do you engage in ongoing collaboration with the content area teacher to develop units of study design  lessons and select appropriate materials and instructional strategies for all students.    Thank you.
1272028,2014,477047,2014-06-02 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for June 22014.    How do you articulate areas in need of improvement in your lesson delivery for all students and specifically those with disabilities and then identify a plan of action?    Thank you
1272028,2014,477189,2014-06-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Here are the results of the observation for June 62014.    I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for the dedication you have shown for the math and science department and your students. I am sure that your students have had a great learning experience this year.
1272028,2015,507939,2014-10-17 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Joanna  It was a pleasure to watch you teach 603 social studies with your co-teacher Ms. Catapano.  Highlights:  It was great to see your students so engaged in the writing process as they researched and drafted their essay about the Early Man in your geography unit.  You worked closely with many students during writing conferences and assessed the needs and supported your special education students.  The rubric/checklist was an effective scaffold that supported the writing of each paragragh.  The built-in questions helped students discuss and process the information before they wrote about it.  Once drafted students worked in partnerships to peer review and edit each section.  Wonderings:  Consider adding the essential question to the top of the rubric with the learning target clearly written and aligned to the standards.  This will help students connect back to the theme identify their accomplishment of meeting the standards and clearly articulate what they have done.  For example "I can describe and explain how the early man evolved by using natural resources and technology by writing an information essay."   Next month when I visit again I will look for your learning targets and how they impact your lesson.  Please see attached learning target handouts to support your work.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1272028,2015,581171,2015-01-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Dear Joanna    When I entered the room the students were engaged in a S.S. vocabulary review drill with your co-teacher.  You recognized that 2 students had missed a prior lesson and you moved them into a group that you worked with while the co-teacher worked with the majority of the students.  This was a very smart way for those students to catch up ask questions about the previous work and complete the prior notebook assignment.  The small group work really helped the students and made them feel more confident in working with the rest of the students.    Please continue to work on the types of questions that are asked of the students.  The students were working well with DOK 1 & 2 but DOK 3 (evidence explain thinking conclusions) was missing.  The students were able to recall what an Egyptian doctor did when working with a mummy but was never asked why this was important in the culture of the time or to compare this to any other culture that had already been studied.       Thank you for allowing me to come into the room to watch the lesson.
1272028,2015,685664,2015-04-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Golebiowski  It was a pleasure to visit your 6th grade ICT lesson on calculating the size of the Roman Empire its distance between other cities within the empire and using mathematical evidence to explain why it is not the center of the empire.  Students needed to use the map rulers map scale and calculate the distances working independently.  Students were engaged in the activity as you visited students who had questions and needed some guidance.  Your handout helped scaffold the activity and overall the activity was a great way to connect how the geography impacted the power of the empire.  Next Steps:  Consider adding a discussion question to the end of the activity to make this connection between geography and power such as "What would be a disadvantage for Rome if they are not the center of the empire?"  This will bring the activity from simply a math activity to a deeper discussion about the dismantling of the Roman Empire.  Thanks for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1272028,2015,771681,2015-06-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Golebiowshi    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. You have been able to create an environment that promotes learning for your students. As an ICT teacher you have worked to differentiate the lesson for all of your students . The plan you gave me showed that great time was invested in preparation.I look forward to the work we have to do together. Have a great summer!    Thank You    Mr. Stanislaus
1272028,2016,866324,2015-12-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Golebiowksi     I enjoyed watching you teach class 604 today- I was impressed with the relationships that you have established with your students.    As discussed in our debrief the co-teaching model that you and Ms. Catapano used today did not allow me to observe and rate two of the instructional components. While "One Teach One Assist" is an option for  co-teaching it does not always create a powerful instructional partnership to most effectively support all students including students with disabilities.   As mentioned please let me know when I can observe you again using a different co-teaching approach. If you are interested I would be happy to meet to discuss other models with you and/or Ms. Catapano.    Sincerely    Marcy
1272028,2016,869344,2016-01-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,This is a grade 6 ICT class.    The Learning Target for this lesson was I can list and interpret the various ways Egyptian doctors have added to the knowledge of medicine.  When I entered the room the students were individually creating a graphic organizer which would list 4 reasons people go to the doctor.  When the majority of the students completed the task the students stood on 2 lines to articulate 1 reason that they had listed and then they sat down.  This same procedure was done but with the time frame of 2700-1100 BC.  You were working with a group of students who were struggling with the task.  You made sure that those students were able to contribute to the answer line (although they had not yet completed the task).    The students then moved to a reading passage and notes were given.  You moved to students who appeared to be struggling with the task and assisted each child as needed.
1272028,2016,895546,2016-02-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Golebiowski    I enjoyed observing your classroom today. Your role as the "Teacher" in the co-teaching model "One Teach One Assist" demonstrated your knowledge of both content and how students learn best including your use of compare/contrast an effective teaching strategy.    You may consider looking at Domain 3 Instruction. To move from "Effective" to "Highly Effective" in the three components students take initiative for their learning. If your are interested in exploring these practices I'd be happy to discuss them and ways to implement in your classroom.
1272028,2016,1009883,2016-05-18 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Golebiowski  It was a pleasure to visit your social studies class with 604.  Students read aloud from the text about Feudalism as they thought about the big questions: How was social structure organized in the middle ages?  Who had more rights?  You asked students to work independently on rereading the text and defining one class in the social structure (they were assigned either serf noblewoman knight lord or vassal) by jotting notes about that role in society rights and other facts from the text.  Students working on the same class of people then shared compared and discussed their notes before compiling them onto a poster.  Next Steps:  1. Consider having some of your students preview the text since reading it prior to the lesson would increase their comprehension and engagement in the lesson.  This can happen at project REAL with you or by themselves for homework.  Also try reading the text aloud to the class instead of round-robin style to increase comprehension (your reading voice and style is more fluent and nuanced than the students). It will also save class time.  2. How will the students learn about the other fuedal classes?  Will groups share out?  Consider having them take notes as they did today on all the other classes and then comparing their notes to the charts that each group made today.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.

1315674,2014,45633,2013-10-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Strengths:  Throughout your lesson you demonstrated knowledge of content and pedagogy. You took time to provide your students with clear explanations of the content.  It was clear that all of your students knew what was expected of them. You have created an environment of respect and rapport.Your monitoring of student behavior was done in a calm and consistent manner.     Growth:    Using questions and discussion techniques: As our science dept. continues to grow we want to be more consistent in asking questions of high quality because they cause students to think and reflect to deepen their understanding test ideas against their classmates. During your lesson planning it is important to continue to list challenging questions in anticipation of students being able to challenge one another's thinkingand developing students who will ensure that all voices are heard.     Next Steps:     On Nov. 25 2013 I will be attending an all day workshop on "Questioning Techniques in the Common Core Classroom". I will then turnkey this information to the entire science dept. We can also set up a meeting to discuss how to better implement the strategies in your classroom.
1315674,2014,77600,2013-12-11 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,As you plan your upcoming lessons think about the DOK - the questions that will push students' thinking and help make the activity more rigorous.  In science the activity content and concept may be rigorous but only if the students truly understand the bigger picture.  Scaffold your questioning to include low level questions that access prior knowledge but that lead to high level thinking questions that help students understand what they are working toward (predicting conclusions based on data analyzing the data).  Sometimes it takes days for students to discover the answers but the questions should still be asked so that students can work toward them.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication!
1315674,2014,238310,2014-04-08 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),DILEO BERNER LENORE,I enjoyed watching your lesson on simple machines with class 611!  Next Steps:  As discussed in our feedback session to increase participation and engagement have all students work in pairs to guess the machine they describe to one another.  This way all students will be actively engaged in thinking and talking and not just listening to others in the whole class discussion.  As you facilitate select a few students to share out to the whole class.  Consider going back to the Learning Target and have students articulate how a simple machine's structure relate to its function.  Thanks for your dedication to your students!
1315674,2014,299470,2014-05-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,You have continued to establish an environment of respect and rapport and a culture for learning through you planning  instruction and professional responsibilities.     In terms of designing student assessment 1f. could you give me a copy of the assessments you have been or will be using in the Soil Study. As we move students in this area it would be good to see evidence of student contribution to the development those assessments.     Thank You.
1315674,2014,383862,2014-05-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Below are questions for you to think about as we begin the planning process for the next academic year.    How do you present questions in varying modalities according to students' needs?  How are the questions you ask specific guiding and open-ended as appropriate in order to scaffold students' critical thinking?    Thank you
1315674,2015,513483,2014-10-23 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Steven  It was great to watch you co-teach with Lauren and Melissa!  It was evident that a lot of planning went into this lesson.  Google classroom is a new to our curriculum but this lesson clearly showed it as a great tool for peer assessing self-assessment and the writing process.  The writing of current events should improve with this process in tandem with the rubric.   Wonderings:  Now that you have prepared the foundation what are some other applications and ways that you will be using google classroom?  I look forward to spending more time with you and your students this year!  Thank you so much for your dedication to your students' growth and achievement.
1315674,2015,526307,2014-11-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Steve  This lesson on Ebola was chock full of engaging ways to gather evidence on a topic.  You included multiple modalities for learning - listening by watching a visual (video) kinestetic (students walked around reading posters)quiet reading discussions and taking notes on reading.  Each of these skills is vital for 8th graders to learn practice and master by the end of the year.  I really liked how you redirected noisy students to read silently so that they could actually process the information before taking their notes. Walking around the room to gather information from other students' work really validates the process of the activity and student work in general.  Next Steps -   -I love that you had a Learning Target/I CAN statement; next time try connecting it to a standard whether it be a state science standard or a reading/writing standard from the CCLS. See attached.  -Since they were learning the basics about this particular disease consider adding higher order thinking questions related to the essential question.  That would help link the details of this virus to the larger issues around an outbreak infectious diseases in general or simply an application to their life. Although the basic facts and vocabulaty terms are super important in science critical thinking questions can help push 8th grade studetns' thinking to a more sophisticated discussion.  Bravo!
1315674,2015,608159,2015-02-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Sandman  It was a pleasure to visit your 8th grade science class in the library today as you tackle science literacy and provide tools for students to complete a comprehensive scientific Exit Project. Your presentation was clear and concise allowing students to use the bulk of the period to work on their bibliographies.  After your presentation students understood the importance of credible research and how to use EasyBib to help them analyze their resources and decide whether or not they are valid and credible. Students were able to use their research links they had saved in their googledocs with EasyBib to analyze and then create their bibliographies for their Exit Project.  Students worked collaboratively to complete this work and you and the librarian provided support as they went through their list of resources and article links.  You provided your students with a great tool they will use for many years to come whenever they need to create a bibliography.  Thank you for your dedication to your students and your teaching craft.
1315674,2015,707607,2015-05-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Sandman    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your classroom. Both you and your co teacher are doing an amazing job which is evidenced by the care and preparation that goes into each classroom lesson. Just some questions to think about:    How do students know the assessment criteria?  How do you and your co teacher determine if all students met the learning outcome?    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus

The  planing that must take place in order to produce a lesson that uses technology and activities that  involve all of your students  is well thought out. The grade planning is evident from visits to other eight grade classes.     On the next visit to your class I will focus on the questioning and discussion techniques used to engage the class.    Thank you    Mr. G Stanislaus
1315674,2016,798465,2015-10-29 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Sandman  I enjoyed your lesson with the Learning Target: I can explain the ideas behind the cell theory.  Students discussed "What is a Theory?" in their groups and shared-out.  The video you showed helped them find evidence for the cell theory and you provided more discussion time for students.  Students appeared cognitively engaged throughout the video and discussions able to make connections with the cell theory.  The homework/graphic organizer provided more time to think about proving the cell theory and connect it to examples and facts.  Next Steps:  Steve - I think you already do this but we need to do more of it as a department and especially in grade 8.  Keep these questions as a guide for developing plans in your team:  How do we continue to challenge students to think deeply about science and developing their own questions? How can we plan discussion questions that help students make connections to science concepts and push their thinking?  How do we keep students engaged in the work?  How do we keep them accountable in interesting and engaging ways?  Thank you for the innovations that you bring to our school and to the science department!!

When i walk into your room regardless of what the lesson topic is the environment feels like a freshmen college science class. You have really set a standard for your students and the science department. A few questions below to consider as we move forward.   How do you use discussions to increase student participation and engagement?  How did you connect pair group and class discussions to writing and /or opportunities to extend thinking?    Thank you  Mr. G Stanislaus
1315674,2016,985571,2016-04-22 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Sandman    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. Mr. Sandman you have created an environment for learning for all of your students. Throughout this lesson you were able to use discussion to increase student participation and engagement.You did ask questions that made students think and reflect to deepen their understanding.    How do you know the feedback helped improve student performance?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
1315674,2017,1057179,2016-10-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Sandman    Thank you for the opportunity to visit with your class. As the entire 8th grade class prepares to take the living environment regents your preparation continues to build a sense of confidence in your students. In addition you are getting them ready for the Gowanas canal project you started last year.    Take a look at the following questions on using assessment.    1. How do the students know the assessment criteria?  2. How do you know that all students met the learning outcome?    Thank you for your beyond the call of duty commitment to our school and your students .     Mr. Greg Stanislaus
1317843,2014,22769,2013-10-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,STRENGTHS:  Throughout the lesson activity you were able to utilize the other teacher in the room along with the paraprofessional. This enabled you to assess where the student were as individuals.This was evidenced by the way you called the class back together to discuss a common challenge the class was having with a particular concept.   You demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness in how you adjusted your instruction in response to students lack of understanding.    GROWTH:    Knowing your students and where they are academically you will be able to anticipate the materials needed before the class starts which will eliminate the time used during class to print off copies and materials. This will increase the smooth functioning of all routines and instructional time.    NEXT STEPS:    Over the next two weeks I would like to see how you incorporate this detail into your lesson plans. I will meet with you on Nov. 14 2013 to discuss. At that time i will also be looking and discussing your questioning an discussion techniques.
1317843,2014,158888,2014-01-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Suhill    Although there are many areas that you have continued to develop in your classes I would like to see you focus on the systems and structure of continuing to develop the students behavior. I have several books I would like for you to review. Over the next week March 102014) please make an appointment to see me so that we can discuss strategies.
1317843,2014,351066,2014-05-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Suhail over the past several months I have witnessed you making some positive changes in you classroom. You are continuing to work to establish an environment of respect and rapport and a culture for learning.     In order to complete your annual evaluation I am asking that you submit artifacts to support Domain 1. Planning and preparation.     In addition on Friday during your prep stop by my office so that we can discuss other areas of focus.     One area of focus is 3b. Questioning and Discussion Techniques.   Please view the video below.      Using Questioning to Develop Understanding  View resource @ teachingchannel.org  https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/questioning-in-the-classroom     Thank you

How do you implement instruction that is individually developed to address a specific child's needs that result from his or her disability?    How do you ensure that all students are engaged in academically and developmentally appropriate activities related to the instructional outcome?     Thank you.
1317843,2014,434292,2014-05-28 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,9,Informal Classroom Observation (Option #2),STANISLAUS GREGORY,

Mr. Suhail  Please feel free to come and see me before the end of the school year. I do want to say that several weeks ago I did observe you in the after school session. You were able to assist a student in math with great success. I believe you work well in a one to one situation with students.    Thank You
1355587,2015,579335,2014-11-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Levinson    It is clear that you have developed a great relationship with your students. As we move forward we will focus on the questioning and discussion techniques during the  lesson. I will forward several resources for you to see dealing with questioning .Thank you    G. Stanislaus
1355587,2015,548804,2014-11-13 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,This class is challenging.  The varied levels of student performance is well managed by the co-teachers in the room.  The evidence of planning shows in the seemless way that the teachers interact with each other and the class.    Please continue to work with your co-teacher and "turn-key" your success to the other ICT teams in the building.
1355587,2015,606393,2015-02-06 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Levinson  Thank you for inviting me into this lesson .  The unit question "Is it possible to have progress without sacrificing the less powerful?" led to a wonderful discussion and powerful ads.  The ideas that were presented and the rubric for gathering information from the student work was well done.  The ICT students in the class had the proper differentiation and were able to celebrate success.  The Social Studies ICT team in grade 8 is a model for the other teams in the building.
1355587,2015,663414,2015-03-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Mr. Levinson    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. You and your co teacher ensured that all students were involved in the lesson.     How do you check for student understanding throughout the lesson?  How do you provide students with feedback on their progress?    Than you     Mr. G Stanislaus
1355587,2015,712668,2015-05-05 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,The class was at the beginning of the unit on business and economics.  The class had a variety of handouts and the ultimate goal was for each group to create a business model and justify the corporation.  The teachers in the room had created a rich set of essential questions and an example for the students to refer to as they dug deeper into the lesson.  This lesson because it was at the start of the unit required the students to look at the readings for very specific and basic information.    Mr. Levinson    Your interaction with the group is wonderful and anyone who comes into the room can see the deep respect the students have for you and you have for them.  You moved to each group and helped them work through the questions and information.  The students were aware of the criteria for answering the questions.  I look forward to the completion of the project and the students peer/self assessment.
1355587,2015,718841,2015-05-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Levinson  It was a pleasure to visit your social studies lesson with ICT class 803.  You were modeling how to analyze a political cartoon.  You highlighted certain parts of the drawing and asked questions to help students think critically about the symbolism in the cartoon. Students had an opportunity to analyze other cartoons in small groups using your strategies during the activity.  Students had to think critically about the drawings symbolism and unit content to understand their meaning.  Analyzing political cartoons and thinking critically about political issues is an important skill in social studies and in life.  Thank you for your hard work and dedication to your students.
1355587,2016,833222,2015-12-04 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Mr. Levinson     As I mentioned post-observation the lesson you facilitated today was highly effective. Your knowledge of content and pedagogy your planning and preparation and the classroom environment you have created with your co-teacher all led to students challenged as critical thinkers engaged in high-level discourse and self-monitoring their learning.    I look forward to coming in again!    Marcy
1355587,2016,862193,2015-12-21 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,SPETH NANCE,Mr. Levinson    When I entered the room you were working one-on-one with a students who needed direct help you then moved to the group of students who had self-assessed as struggling with the work.  Your co-teacher moved to the next group and both of you covered the room seamlessly.  The students color coded sections of the work to identify where he/she thought help was needed and the students worked together to complete the assignment.  Thank you for creating the presentation for the staff on "touchy topics".  Your ability to negotiate the world of issues for the students (without making anyone uncomfortable) and translating it into a teaching tool for your fellow teachers was wonderful.  It is a pleasure to visit your room thank you.
1355587,2016,933309,2016-03-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Mr. Levinson  It was a pleasure to visit your science class with 810 as you co-taught with Mr. Sandman.  It was clear that you had co-planned your lesson based on what you learned last week in our PD about helping students make meaning out of difficult texts with visual supports and 'previewing' material.  Your lesson resources and supports had been posted on your googleclassroom page so that students could watch them before the lesson to get a head start on the content.  Students had some background knowledge on the digestive system and through a podcast text and visual of the alimentary canal students were expected to identify the function of each organ and classify as mechanical or chemical digestion.  Throughout the lesson students had opportunities to write sketch question listen to visualize read and talk about the content.  Since the text was written at a high level students could watch the video first (on laptops at their tables)to gain knowledge of the organ systems to reinforce the reading.  Next Steps:  -Provide more opportunities for student talk - either during a turn and talk to share notes and ideas or by jig-sawing the information by table students can better synthesize the information and articulate the function of each organ and how it contributes to digestion.  -Continue to think of new ways of 'previewing.'  Morning tutoring or posting before the actual lesson can give many students a head start on learning reducing remedial work.  Thank you for your thoughtful collaborative work and your dedication to your students.
1355587,2016,947990,2016-03-24 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,
1434241,2016,824442,2015-11-09 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Pleskova    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. All of your students seem to understand what is expected of them and work to achieve that standard. I really liked the fact that you and your co teacher thought to use seating arrangements to work directly with the students who were struggling with the different concepts.     Moving forward we will focus on student engagement questioning and discussion techniques.     How do yo ask questions that make students think and reflect to deepen their understanding?  How do you use discussion among students? Why?    Thank you    Mr. G. Stanislaus
1434241,2016,813736,2015-11-16 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Pleskova    I enjoyed observing your classroom today in particular how you engaged students by connecting the topics to their own lives. As I mentioned in our debrief conversation I'd recommend having students work in groups and posing open ended questions that will challenge and advance their thinking versus asking questions that lead to a single response.     You said the culminating activity to this unit is independent student projects on ecosystems- I would enjoy seeing them so please let me know when they are presenting!    thank you    Marcy
1434241,2016,920481,2016-03-01 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Pleskova  It was a pleasure to visit your science class with class 610.  Students were discussing their observations from Part I of the experiment and getting ready to start Part II.  You asked a series of questions to get students to think about what had happened to the dry ice in Part I so that they would be ready to compare observations with Part II using water ice.  Students followed your instructions as you walked them through the procedures and help them analyze their observations through questioning.  Students completed their lab report pages in the graphic organizer your provided. This lesson was well organized planned and paced with multiple supports for all learners.  Next Steps:  1. Provide more opportunities for students to talk to one another.  Questions like "What is your hypothesis? or "Why is the ice floating?" are excellent questions for group talk.  All students can participate with greater engagement when they can discuss with peers rather than listen to one student answer a teacher's question in front of the whole class.   2. Plan for a time later in the year when you remove the scaffold of completing the lab together so that students can follow procedures in groups by reading instructions on their own.    Thank you for your dedication to your students and your craft!
1434241,2016,987007,2016-05-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Pleskova    Thank you for allowing me to visit your class. All of your students were engaged in the lesson and were able to make connections with the trip to the canal the previous day. The input from both you as the lead teacher and your co teacher created a learning environment that supported the students.     What was the criteria for assessing the students' work?  How do the students use the assessment criteria to check their work?    Thank you  Mr. G. Stanislaus
1434241,2017,1097137,2016-10-07 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Pleskova    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to visit your class. Your students are enjoying the curriculum which is evident by their excitement during the debate. I want to thank you for all of the work and commitment you demonstrate to all of your students. Please review the questions below.    1. How do you use discussion to increase student participation and engagement?  What criteria or tools do you use to craft questions? (beyond the given curriculum)    Thank you   Gregory Stanislaus
1505281,2016,791656,2015-10-14 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Arniella    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Both you and your co-teacher seem to have found a great balance and working relationship. As we move forward I will notify you of the next visit so that we can focus on 3(b) questioning and discussion techniques and  3(d) assessment in instruction. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.     Thank you  G Stanislaus
1505281,2016,789063,2015-10-20 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,As discussed it was great at the onset to observe students with differentiated work. The main activity was fun and engaging for everyone completing it however the two students that had different activities may have been more engaged if their activities were more closely aligned to the main one.
1505281,2016,875106,2016-01-15 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STANISLAUS GREGORY,Ms. Arniella    Thank you for the opportunity to visit your class. Your students were being given the chance to really work together and think about the problem at hand. Both you and your co teacher have established an environment conducive for learning and feeling safe to take chances in their thinking. I will announce the next observation and would like to see you take more of a lead in the instruction of the class.Below are a few questions to think about as we move forward.    How do you provide students with feedback on their progress?  How do the students use the assessment criteria to check their work?    Thank you     Mr. G Stanislaus
1505281,2016,885702,2016-01-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Arniella  It was a pleasure to visit your 7th grade math class as they started a new topic within unit 4 Percent Contexts aligned to the common core standard 7.RP.  The motivation to the lesson was engaging as they watched a video on Japanese Sneakerheadz and gained a context for how percents and commissions are an integral part of buying and selling and may effect their lives as a seller or buyer of sneakers.  Using the sneaker example Mr. Ng had the students looking at a website to buy sneakers and calculate percentage of commissions for the company.  You were sitting with a group to scaffold the pace of questioning and break down the problem into steps.    Next Steps:  Working in small groups to assist and guide learning can be effective but I am wondering if you and your co-teacher can better meet the needs of your class of diverse learners by informally assessing students needs (students can even self-assess)and then directing students to different stations to meet those needs.  For example one group that needs further instruction can meet with you for reteaching manipulatives or answering questions.  A second group could just be given more practice problems and a third group can tackle challenge problems both facilitated by the GE teacher.  This co-teaching model saves time and strategically adjusts lessons to meet the needs of all learners based on your formative assessment.  Please let me know when I can see you and your co-teacher parallel teach or station teach during one of your math classes.  Thank you for your dedication to your students.
1505281,2016,888582,2016-01-27 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,DILEO BERNER LENORE,Dear Ms. Arniella  Thank you for inviting me in to your class to see another lesson on calculating commissions.  You planned and executed a mini-lesson that would help students understand how commissions/percentages are used in a real-world scenario of auctions.  You engaged students in your own story about buying/selling expensive famous artworks with brokers and millionaires/celebrities and made a connection to college and careers.  You showed a video of a live auction and students were excited and surprised to see a painting sell for $160000000.00 sight unseen!  As they did the day before students practiced how to calculate the amount of commission made by the company.  Students shared their answers and showed more than one way of calculating the percentages of the deal and how much the seller and broker took of the profits.  Next Steps/Wonderings:  What assessment did you use to know which students needed more practice remediation or were ready for an extension of the topic? How does this inform your grouping as well?  Consider using Mastery Connect to gather timely information about student mastery and better inform your planning in order to meet the needs of all your students.  Thank you for working closely and cooperatively with your team!
1505281,2016,920871,2016-03-03 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Arniella     As discussed in our debrief today the co-teaching model that you and Mr. Ng used in this lesson did not allow me to observe and rate two of the instructional components. While "One Teach One Assist" is an option for co-teaching it does not always create a powerful instructional partnership to most effectively support all students including students with disabilities so I am glad to hear that you and Mr. Ng select and vary the model frequently and according to student needs.    Sincerely    Marcy
1505281,2017,1073821,2016-10-26 00:00:00.000,15K051,M.S. 51 William Alexander,8,Informal Observation,STERLIS MARCELLA,Dear Ms. Arniella    What a great co-taught lesson! I thoroughly enjoyed observing your students work with one another and engage in an activity that promoted critical thinking. I am now promoting figuring problems out by writing on desks in magic marker!       Marcy
